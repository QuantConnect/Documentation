<p>You must <a href="/docs/v2/research-environment/charting/seaborn#02-Preparation">import the plotting libraries and get some historical data</a> to create candlestick charts.</p>

<p>In this example, you create a line chart that shows the closing price for one of the banking securities. Follow these steps to create the line chart:</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python"># Select a symbol to plot the candlestick plot.
symbol = symbols[0]

# Obtain the close price series of the symbol to plot.
data = history.loc[symbol]['close']

# Call the plot method with a title and figure size to plot the line chart.
plot = sns.lineplot(data=data,
                    x='time', 
                    y='close')
# In the same cell that you called the lineplot method, call the set method with the y-axis label and a title to update the plot settings.
plot.set(ylabel="price", title=f"{symbol} Price Over Time")</pre>
</div>

<p>The Jupyter Notebook displays the line chart.</p>
