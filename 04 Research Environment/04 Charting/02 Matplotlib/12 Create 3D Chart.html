<p>You must <a href="/docs/v2/research-environment/charting/matplotlib#02-Preparation">import the plotting libraries and get some historical data</a> to create candlestick charts.</p>

<p>In this example, you create a 3D chart that shows the price of an asset on each dimension, i.e. the price correlation of 3 different symbols. Follow these steps to create the 3D chart:</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python"># Select the asset to plot on each dimension.
x, y, z = symbols[:3]

# Select the close price series of each symbol to plot with.
x_hist = history.loc[x].close
y_hist = history.loc[y].close
z_hist = history.loc[z].close

# Construct the basic 3D plot layout.
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
ax = fig.add_subplot(projection='3d')

# Call the ax.scatter method with the 3 price series to plot the 3D graph.
ax.scatter(x_hist, y_hist, z_hist)

# Update the x, y, and z axis labels.
ax.set_xlabel(f"{x} Price")
ax.set_ylabel(f"{y} Price")
ax.set_zlabel(f"{z} Price")

# Display the 3D chart. Note that you need to zoom the chart to avoid z-axis cut off.
ax.set_box_aspect(None, zoom=0.85)
plt.show()</pre>
</div>

<p>The Jupyter Notebook displays the pie chart.</p>
