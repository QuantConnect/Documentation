<p>You need some <a href="/docs/v2/research-environment/machine-learning/stable-baselines#03-Get-Historical-Data">historical data</a> to prepare the data for the model. If you have historical data, manipulate it to train and test the model.
In this example, we extract the close price series as outcome and obtain partial-differencing time-series of OHLCV as observation:</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python">history = df.unstack(0)
# we arbitrarily select weight 0.5 here, but ideally one should strike a balance between variance retained and stationarity.
partial_diff = (history.diff() * 0.5 + history * 0.5).iloc[1:].fillna(0)
history = history.close.iloc[1:]</pre>
</div>
