<p>The following examples demonstrate some common practices for using the Keras library.</p>

<h4>Example 1: Predict Return Direction</h4>
<p>The following research notebook uses <code>Keras</code> machine learning model to predict the next day's return direction by the previous 5 days' close price differences.</p>
