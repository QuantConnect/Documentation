<p>The following examples demonstrate some common practices for using the <code>Hmmlearn</code> library.</p>

<h4>Example 1: Regime Detection</h4>
<p>The following research notebook uses <code>Hmmlearn</code> machine learning model to obtain the current market regime and predict the conditional probabilities of each market state that the current regime would turn into by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).</p>
