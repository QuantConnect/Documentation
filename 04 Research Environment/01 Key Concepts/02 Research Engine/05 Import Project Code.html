<p class='csharp'>To import code from your code files to your Research Environment session, use Python.</p>

<p class='python'>
One of the drawbacks of using the Research Environment you may encounter is the need to rewrite code you've already written in a file in the backtesting environment. Instead of rewriting the code, you can import the methods from the backtesting environment into the Research Environment to reduce development time. For example, say you have the following <span class="public-file-name">helpers.py</span> file in your project:</p>

<div class='python'>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="python">def add(a, b): 
   return a+b
</pre>
</div></div>

<p class='python'>To import the preceding method into your research notebook, use the <code>import</code> statement.</p>

<div  class='python'>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">from helpers import Add

# reuse method from helpers.py
Add(3, 4)</pre>
</div></div>

<p class='python'>If you adjust the file that you import, restart the Research Environment session to import the latest version of the file. To restart the Research Environment, <a href='/docs/v2/research-environment/key-concepts/getting-started#05-Stop-Nodes'>stop the research node</a> and then <a href='/docs/v2/research-environment/key-concepts/getting-started#03-Open-Notebooks'>open the notebook</a> again.</p>
