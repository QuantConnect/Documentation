<p>Once we are confident in our hypothesis, we can export this code into backtesting. One way to accomodate this model into backtest is to create a scheduled event which uses our model to predict the expected return. Since we could calculate the expected return, we'd use Mean-Variance Optimization for portfolio construction.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python">def Initialize(self) -&gt; None:

    #1. Required: Five years of backtest history
    self.SetStartDate(2008, 1, 1)
    self.SetEndDate(2021, 1, 1)

    #2. Required: Alpha Streams Models:
    self.SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.AlphaStreams)

    #3. Required: Significant AUM Capacity
    self.SetCash(1000000)

    #4. Required: Benchmark to SPY
    self.SetBenchmark("SPY")

    self.assets = ["SPY", "TLT"]    # "TLT" as fix income in out-of-market period (high volatility)
    
    # Add Equity ------------------------------------------------ 
    for ticker in self.assets:
        self.AddEquity(ticker, Resolution.Minute)
    
    # Set Scheduled Event Method For Kalman Filter updating.
    self.Schedule.On(self.DateRules.EveryDay(), 
        self.TimeRules.BeforeMarketClose("SPY", 5), 
        self.EveryDayBeforeMarketClose)</pre>
</div>

<p>Now we export our model into the scheduled event method. We will switch <code>qb</code> with <code>self</code> and replace methods with their <code>QCAlgorithm</code> counterparts as needed. In this example, this is not an issue because all the methods we used in research also exist in <code>QCAlgorithm</code>.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python">def EveryDayBeforeMarketClose(self) -&gt; None:
    qb = self
    
    # Get history
    history = qb.History(["SPY"], datetime(2010, 1, 1), datetime.now(), Resolution.Daily)
        
    # Get the close price daily return.
    close = history['close'].unstack(level=0)
    
    # Call pct_change to obtain the daily return
    returns = close.pct_change().iloc[1:]
            
    # Initialize the HMM, then fit by the standard deviation data.
    model = MarkovRegression(returns, k_regimes=2, switching_variance=True).fit()
        
    # Obtain the market regime
    regime = model.smoothed_marginal_probabilities.values.argmax(axis=1)[-1]

    # ==============================
    
    if regime == 0:
        self.SetHoldings([PortfolioTarget("TLT", 0.), PortfolioTarget("SPY", 1.)])
    else:
        self.SetHoldings([PortfolioTarget("TLT", 1.), PortfolioTarget("SPY", 0.)])</pre>
</div>
