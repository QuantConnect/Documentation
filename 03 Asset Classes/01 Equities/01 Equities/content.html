		There are roughly 16,400 symbols of survivorship bias free, split and dividend adjusted US equities data from  Jan 1998 to today provided by QuantQuote. US Equities data by default arrives in adjusted format.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our data is provided by QuantQuote and is <b>trade</b> data only only with tick, second, minute, hour and daily resolutions available.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Tick data is raw and unfiltered - which includes suspicious, untradable and off market ticks. This can often result in unrealistic backtests. Before using tick data you should fully understand all the exchange codes and the "suspicious" flag which indicates a tick you should ignore. Unless you're an expert you should use the pre-filtered second and minute data.
	</p>
	<p>
		In backtesting QuantConnect tick data is ordered but rounded to the previous second. There is no millisecond timestamp on the data.
