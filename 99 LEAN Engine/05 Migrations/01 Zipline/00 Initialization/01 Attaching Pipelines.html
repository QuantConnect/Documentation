    The functional equivalent of Pipelines on QuantConnect are Universes.
    Universes can be used to dynamically select assets your algorithm wants to trade
    or request data from. To add a universe to your algorithm, you can call the <code>AddUniverse()</code> method
    and provide the required Coarse and Fine universe selection functions.
</p>
<p>
    Coarse Universe selection is the first step of universe selection. It provides a means to filter data
    in a lightweight fashion before proceeding to Fine Universe selection. Coarse universe will allow you to
    filter assets based off top-level fundamental factors, such as Dollar Volume for the day, if a company has fundamental data,
    and market of the asset.
</p>
<p>
    Fine Universe selection is the second step of universe selection. It provides fundamental data
    to your user-defined function, and can be used to filter in greater detail based on
    an asset's fundamental data, such as earnings, EPS, etc.
</p>
<p>
    An example of coarse and fine universe selection to filter assets in our algorithm is provided.
    Adding universes can be used as an alternative to using <code>AddEquity</code> if you prefer
    dynamic asset selection.

<p>
    You can configure universe settings by modifying the existing <code>UniverseSettings</code> attribute of the algorithm.
