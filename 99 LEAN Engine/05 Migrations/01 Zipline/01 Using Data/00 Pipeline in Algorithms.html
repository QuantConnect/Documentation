    As covered in the <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/quantopian-migration/initialization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Initialization</a> section,
    Pipelines can be replicated using Universe Selection in QuantConnect, albeit with some additional steps in between and a performance impact.
</p>
<p>
    In this section, we will construct and define an equivalent pipeline model using universe selection in QuantConnect.
    We will filter our data set in Coarse and Fine, and apply an additional filter to historical data with a rolling window.
</p>
<p>
    We first create a skeleton algorithm definition to begin setting up our Pipeline.
    Note that this algorithm will allow all equities through, which will have a substantial performance
    impact on our algorithm. 
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python">class MyPipelineAlgorithm(QCAlgorithm):
    def Initialize(self):
        self.SetStartDate(2020, 1, 1)
        self.SetEndDate(2020, 10, 20)

        self.AddUniverse(self.CoarseSelectionFunction, self.FineSelectionFunction)

    def CoarseSelectionFunction(self, coarse):
        # Allows all Symbols through, no filtering applied
        return [coarse_data.Symbol for coarse_data in coarse]

    def FineSelectionFunction(self, fine):
        # Allows all Symbols through, no filtering applied
        return [fine_data.Symbol for fine_data in fine]</pre>
</div>
<p>
    The skeleton algorithm is the equivalent of the Pipeline call below.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python">from quantopian.pipeline import Pipeline
from quantopian.pipeline.domain import US_EQUITIES
from quantopian.research import run_pipeline

pipe = Pipeline(columns={}, domain=US_EQUITIES)
run_pipeline(pipe, '2020-01-01', '2020-10-20')</pre>
</div>

<p>
    The equivalent of <code>Pipeline(screen=...)</code> resolves to the filter applied at the Coarse and Fine stages
    of universe selection.

    Let's define a filter of stocks with a dollar volume greater than $50000000 USD, as well as
    a rolling thirty day return greater than 2%. Once we've initially filtered the Symbols in Coarse Universe Selection,
    let's define a final filter only allowing stocks with EPS greater than 0.

    Beware of making <code>History()</code> calls with many Symbols. It could potentially cause your algorithm to
    run out of system resources (i.e. RAM) and reduce performance of your algorithm on universe selection.

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python">from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class MyPipelineAlgorithm(QCAlgorithm):
    def Initialize(self):
        self.SetStartDate(2020, 1, 1)
        self.SetEndDate(2020, 10, 20)

        self.AddUniverse(self.CoarseSelectionFunction, self.FineSelectionFunction)

    def CoarseSelectionFunction(self, coarse):
        # Allows all Symbols through, no filtering applied
        dollar_volume_filter_symbols = [coarse_data.Symbol for coarse_data in coarse if coarse_data.DollarVolume > 50000000]

        # Make a history call to calculate the 30 day rolling returns
        df = self.History(dollar_volume_filter_symbols, self.Time - timedelta(days=60), self.Time, Resolution.Daily)

        # Compute the rolling 30 day returns
        df = df['close'].groupby(level=0).filter(lambda x: len(x) >= 30).groupby(level=0).apply(lambda x: (x.iloc[-1] - x.iloc[-30]) / x.iloc[-30])

        # Finally, apply our filter
        dataframe_screen = df[df > 0.02]

        # Filters out any Symbol that is not in the DataFrame
        return [s for s in dollar_volume_filter_symbols if str(s) in dataframe_screen]

    def FineSelectionFunction(self, fine):
        # We receive the filtered symbols from before, and we filter by EPS > 0 in this step
       return [s.Symbol for s in fine if s.EarningReports.BasicEPS.ThreeMonths > 0]</pre>
</div>
<p>
    This class definition is now roughly equivalent to the following <code>CustomFactor</code> and Pipeline call in Quantopian, excluding the EPS filtering.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python">from quantopian.pipeline.filters import QTradableStocksUS
from quantopian.pipeline.factors import AverageDollarVolume

class PercentageChange(CustomFactor):
    def compute(self, today, assets, out, values):
        out[:] = (values[-1] - values[0]) / values[0]

    dollar_volume = AverageDollarVolume(window_length=5)
    dollar_volume_filter = (dollar_volume > 50000000)

    pipe = Pipeline(
        columns={
            "percent_change": PercentageChange(inputs=[USEquityPricing.close], window_length=30)
        },
        screen=(QTradableStocksUS() &amp; dollar_volume_filter)
    )
    </pre>
</div>
<p>
    An example of the shape of the DataFrame returned from History is shown below.
    The DataFrame has a MultiIndex, with <code>level=0</code> being the Symbol, and <code>level=1</code> being the Time
    for that point of data. You can index the Symbol/<code>level=0</code> index by using either the SecurityIdentifier string (e.g. <code>df.loc["AAPL R735QTJ8XC9X"]</code>) or
    with the ticker of the Symbol (e.g. <code>df.loc["AAPL"]</code>)
