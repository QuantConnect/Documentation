<p>
  Mia is an LLM-powered chatbot that can write QuantConnect algorithms, debug your existing code issues, and has deep knowledge of the QuantConnect API. 
  It boasts several powerful features:
</p>

<h4>Context Aware</h4>
<p>Mia knows the project contents and recent error messages during compiling, backtests, or live algorithms. When asked she can interpret the error message and quickly debug the relevant code that needs fixing.</p>

<h4>Code Validation Tools</h4>
<p>Mia has a suite of tools to write high-quality code. She's trained on hundreds of algorithms and thousands of documentation pages to provide contextual assistance for most issues you may encounter when developing a strategy. When asked to write strategies, she uses these to validate (and fix) code before returning the strategies to users. She even runs quick backtests to ensure the code works as expected.</p>

<h4>Agentic Coding</h4>
<p>
  The <span class='page-section-name'>Ask Mia</span> panel in Cloud Platform is where Mia operates as an <span class='new-term'>agentic</span> coding assistant.
  She can autonomously make decisions, set and pursue goals, and take action without constant human oversight.
  Think of agentic coding as a form of pair programming, where you are the observer who gives high-level directions and Mia is the driver who writes the code and calls the QuantConnect API.
