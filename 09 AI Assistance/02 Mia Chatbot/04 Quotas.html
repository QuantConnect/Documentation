<p>
    The quotas don't restore on the first day of the month or the billing date. 
    They restore according to a 1-month rolling window.
    If you exhaust all the AI tokens included with your support seat, <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/credit#06-Purchase-QCC'>buy some QCC</a> to continue using Mia, our agentic AI assistant.
    QCC tokens are consumed at approximately the same rate as the top model from major providers. 
    We provide this value-added wrapper on the major providers so we can offer powerful tools without violating our data licenses, enabling you to easily use the major models and still have the full benefits of QuantConnect.
