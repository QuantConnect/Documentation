<p>
  The QuantConnect Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is a bridge that connects a Large Language Model (LLM) to the <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/api-reference'>QuantConnect API</a>. 
  With this setup, you can prompt the LLM and have it interact with our API on your behalf. 
  This server equips the LLM with tools to create projects, run backtests, deploy live algorithms, and more. 
  Our MCP integration can supercharge your existing workflow on QuantConnect and can even unlock quant trading to non-programmers. 
  Simply prompt the LLM in layperson language and let it do the heavy lifting for you.
