<p>The following sections explain some issues you may encounter and how to resolve them.</p>

<h4>Server Not Connected</h4>
<p>
  When you check the status of the MCP server in the Claude Code panel, it can take up to 10 seconds for the server to start up and for the client to connect to it. 
  If the MCP server doesn't connect after 10 seconds, close the Claude Code panel and re-open a new one.
</p>

<h4>Service Outages</h4>
<p>
  The MCP server relies on the QuantConnect API and the client application. 
  To check the status of the QuantConnect API, see our <a href='https://status.quantconnect.com/'>Status</a> page.
