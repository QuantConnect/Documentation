<p>
  Mia has read and write access to the files in your project. 
  With Mia's deep knowledge of our documentation and LEAN, she can implement any strategy or functionality you request. 
  After writing the code, Mia compiles the project to check for errors. 
  If she detects some errors, she autonomously works to debug and fix them before compiling the project again.
