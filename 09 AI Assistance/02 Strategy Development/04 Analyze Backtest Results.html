  Once your project successfully compiles, Mia launches a backtest to evaluate the strategy's performance. 
  If the algorithm throws errors during execution, Mia catches them and edits the code to solve the problem. 
  When the algorithm runs without error, she reviews the backtest statistics, orders, logs, and more, and then provides a summary of the performance. 
  If you have a specific question about the results, just ask.
