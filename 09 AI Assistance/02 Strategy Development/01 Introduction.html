  Mia is our <span class='new-term'>agentic</span> coding assistant. 
  Think of agentic coding as a form of pair programming, where you are the observer who gives high-level directions and Mia is the driver who writes the code and calls the QuantConnect API. 
  We trained Mia on hundreds of algorithms and thousands of documentation pages to provide contextual assistance for most issues you may encounter when developing a strategy. 
  Agentic conversations like this unlock the ability for everyone to create, research, and deploy algorithmic trading strategies without being an expert programmer.
