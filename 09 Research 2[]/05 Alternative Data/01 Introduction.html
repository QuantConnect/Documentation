There is a vast amount of alternative data available that we can use for developing signals in our Alphas. This allows us to create many unique hypotheses about the relationships between our data sources and the market, such as creating NLP models from twitter data to determine market sentiment or using Federal Reserve data to rebalance a portfolio.
