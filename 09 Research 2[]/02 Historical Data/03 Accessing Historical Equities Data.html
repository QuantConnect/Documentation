QuantConnect provides Equity data from QuantQuote for over 8000 equities going back as far as 1998. The data is available in tick, second, minute, hour, and daily resolution. By default the data is adjusted for dividends and splits. To access the data for a given equity, we must first subscribe to its data using its ticker.

spy = qb.AddEquity("SPY")    # add equity data

<h4> Making history calls </h4>
<p>
The history call requires you to pass in the symbols you wish to retrieve data for, and the period and resolution of the data. 
There are three different ways to make a history call:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<p>
Time Period + Resolution
</p>
	<pre class="all"># Returns the past 10 days of historical daily data
history = qb.History(spy.Symbol, timedelta(days=10), Resolution.Daily)
</pre>
</div>

<div class="section-example-container">
<p>
Bar Period + Resolution
</p>
	<pre class="all"># Returns the past 10 bars of historical daily data
history = qb.History(spy.Symbol, 10, Resolution.Daily) # 10 is number 
</pre>
</div>

<div class="section-example-container">
<p>
Start Time + End Time + Resolution
</p>
	<pre class="all">start_time = datetime(2019, 1, 1) # start datetime for history call
end_time = datetime(2020, 1, 1) # end datetime for history call

# Returns daily historical data between January 1st 2019 and January 1st 2020
history = qb.History(spy.Symbol, start_time, end_time, Resolution.Daily)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If we have subscribed to multiple symbols, we can retrieve a single dataframe which contains historical data for all our symbols, by using <code>qb.History(qb.Securities.Keys, 10, Resolution.Daily)</code>.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">spy = qb.AddEquity("SPY")
tlt = qb.AddEquity("TLT")
gld = qb.AddEquity("GLD")

# Returns daily historical data for all symbols
history = qb.History(qb.Securities.Keys, timedelta(days=10), Resolution.Daily)
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Accessing and manipulating data</h4>
<p>
The dataframe returned will have a column for each data type available. For equities, the dataframe will have a column for Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume data since equity quote data is not yet available. The rows are indexed by time, meaning each OHLC row correlates to one timestamp. The frequency between timestamps will depend on the resolution of data. Rows are also indexed by symbols if multiple symbols were passed into the history call. 
</p>

<p> 
We can use <code>history.loc["SPY"]</code> to access the time series row data for a specific symbol. The row data will contain the open, high, low, close, and volume data for a given timestamp.</p>

<p>
From here, we can then access specific columns. Let's access the time series close data.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">history.loc["SPY"]["close"]
</pre>
</div>
