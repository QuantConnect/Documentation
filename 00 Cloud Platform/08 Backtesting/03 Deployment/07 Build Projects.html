<p>If the compiler finds errors during the build process, the IDE highlights the lines of code that caused the errors in red.
Your projects will automatically build after each keystroke. To manually build a project, <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/getting-started#02-View-All-Projects">open the project</a> and then click the <img class='inline-icon' src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/build-button.png"> <span class="button-name">Build</span> icon. If the build process is unresponsive, try refreshing the page and building again. If the build process continues to be unresponsive, check our <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://status.quantconnect.com/">Status page</a> or <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
