<p>The QuantConnect Paper Trading brokerage supports cash and margin accounts. To set the account type in an algorithm, see the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages/supported-models/quantconnect-paper-trading'>paper trading brokerage model documentation</a>.</p>

<p>If you pass a different <code>BrokerageName</code> to the <code class="csharp">SetBrokerageModel</code><code class="python">set_brokerage_model</code> method, the new brokerage model defines the account types that are available.</p>
