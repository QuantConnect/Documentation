Following the steps above, at this point the indicator object is ready for you to analyse. Each indicator has different properties which you can see from the Reference Table types.</p>
<p>In the example above the <code>BollingerBand.StandardDeviation</code> dataframe column is much smaller than the <code>Upper</code> and <code>Lower</code> band properties. With a little help from pandas we can drop the standard deviation column and plot the remaining ones.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># drop the standard deviation fields
df1_bb.drop('standarddeviation', 1)

# plot the Bollinger Band
df1_bb.plot()
</pre>
</div>
