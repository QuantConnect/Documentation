	QuantConnect provides an environment for you to perform exploratory research and brainstorm new ideas for algorithm. We simply call this the <a  target="_BLANK" href="/research">research</a> environment. Here you can run Python CLI commands and explore the data directly from a <a target="_BLANK" href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a> installed in QuantConnect.
</p>
<p>
	Inside a notebook you can perform virtually any command inside a safe disposable environment. We automatically save your notebook for you. Currently we just support Python 2.7 notebooks.
</p>
 
<p>
	You can share a notebook by clicking the <i class="fa fa-sharing"></i> icon in the bottom right of the page. You can also share a notebook directly to the forums when you create a new discussion or comment.

	The foundational class for access QuantConnect data in Jupyter is the <code>QuantBook</code>. This is a wrapper on the QCAlgorithm class and has many of the same methods. The research environment is currently in beta but we are slowly adding new methods to the QuantBook to expand your research potential. The basic template provides the foundation code required to import the QuantBook class. Specifically:
