QuantConnect supports cryptocurrency backtesting and live trading. We launched 2017 with the Coinbase Pro (formerly GDAX) exchange.

<p>Cryptocurrency trading is handled similarly to a forex transaction; however, the exchanges do not provide the same holdings history as traditional forex brokerages, so it has some unique challenges in live trading that we will go into below. </p>
<p>One common stumbling block that users face designing algorithms with cryptocurrency is a misunderstanding of Cash modeling. Most crypto exchanges only support cash trading, so you cannot place trades when you do not have the cash in your account. 'Cash' in this sense means any of the crypto coin types. </p>
<p>For example, if you have $100,000 USD, but no LTC in your portfolio - you cannot trade BTCLTC, and in order to trade BTCEUR, you need EUR in your portfolio. This means you must make trading decisions based on the <code>Cashbook</code>. This holds your current balance of coins available.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">// Fetch the number of BTC coins in your portfolio.
var btc = Portfolio.CashBook["BTC"].Amount;</pre>
	<pre class="python"># Fetch the number of BTC coins in your portfolio.
btc = self.Portfolio.CashBook["BTC"].Amount</pre>
</div>
<p>Cryptocurrency is also sensitive to transaction fees, so it is important to set the correct BrokerageModel. This also helps your backtesting restrictions behave as close as possible to the production live trading environment.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.GDAX, AccountType.Cash)</pre>
	<pre class="python">self.SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.GDAX, AccountType.Cash)</pre>
</div>
