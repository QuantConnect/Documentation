<p>
QuantConnect provides survivorship bias-free, split- and dividend-adjusted US Equities data from January 1st, 1998 to today on all US stocks. Over this period, a number of new stocks have entered the market, and others have been delisted. When a company name/symbol changes, the data will automatically be mapped over to the original name. By default data is adjusted for <a href="#equity/usa/splits">splits</a> and <a href="#equity/usa/dividends">dividends</a>.
</p>
<p>All data is available in tick, second, minute, hourly, and daily resolution. Tick data is provided in the order the trades were made, but the data itself is time-stamped to the previous second.</p>
<p>The Tick data is raw and unfiltered - which includes suspicious, untradable, and off-market ticks. This can often result in unrealistic backtests. Before using tick data, you should fully understand all the exchange codes and the "suspicious" flag, which indicates a tick you should ignore. Unless you're an expert, you should use the pre-filtered second and minute data.</p>
