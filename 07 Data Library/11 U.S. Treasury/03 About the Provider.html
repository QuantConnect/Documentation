The Department of the Treasury (USDT) is an executive department and the treasury of the United States federal government. 
Established by an Act of Congress in 1789 to manage government revenue, the Treasury prints all paper currency and 
mints all coins in circulation through the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the United States Mint, respectively; collects all 
federal taxes through the Internal Revenue Service; manages U.S. government debt instruments; licenses and supervises 
banks and thrift institutions; and advises the legislative and executive branches on matters of fiscal policy.
