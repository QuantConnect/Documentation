QuantConnect provides US options trade and quote price data from the OPRA feed. This includes approximately 4000 symbols, each of which has roughly 10 strikes on average. For speed options, data is filtered to only load the data you want for your algorithm. You can set this filter with your code or leave it open to pull in all strikes and expiry dates for a given symbol.<br>
