<p>
Algoseek futures data is set in the timezone in which the future is listed. The futures listed in CME or CBOT have their data set in Chicago Time, and the futures listed in NYMEX and Comex have their data set in New York Time. So when accessing futures data, make sure to account for the different time zones.
