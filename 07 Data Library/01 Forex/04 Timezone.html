OANDA data is in UTC timezone. Although many popular charting websites convert this to EST for display, QuantConnect has elected to leave it in UTC and not manipulate the data. When comparing the data to external references, make sure to account for the different time zones.

While Oanda data is in UTC Time, the exchange is set to its local time, New York Time. So data accessed from this brokerage is timestamped in New York Time. Meanwhile, all FXCM data is set in UTC-05 Time, or Eastern Standard Time (EST).
