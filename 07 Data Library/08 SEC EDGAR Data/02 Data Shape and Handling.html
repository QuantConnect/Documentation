    The data is stored as a flat JSON file on disk. In the processing stage, we chose to 
    preserve as many fields as possible without modifying the order in which data is represented.
    This way, we can preserve the structure and essence of the raw data in a structured format.
</p>
<p>
    To access SEC data, you'll need to use one or more of the following data types:

    <table class="table qc-table table-striped">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <td style="font-weight: bold">Form Type</td>
                <td style="font-weight: bold">Data Type</td>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>8-K</td>
                <td>$[SECReport8K,T:QuantConnect.Common.Data.Custom.SEC.SECReport8K]</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>10-K</td>
                <td>$[SECReport10K,T:QuantConnect.Common.Data.Custom.SEC.SECReport10K]</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>10-Q</td>
                <td>$[SECReport10Q,T:QuantConnect.Common.Data.Custom.SEC.SECReport10Q]</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</p>
<p>
    The data is accessible from the derived BaseData instances (SECReport8K, SECReport10K, etc.) under the class field "Report". The "Report" field is of type $[SECReport,T:QuantConnect.Common.Data.Custom.SEC.SECReport]
    and contains all of the report metadata in a structured format. The report documents are left in their original order and are unprocessed.
</p>
<p>
    Note: Since we use the same interface in our BaseData derived classes (ISECReport), we'll use SECReport8K as an example to cover for both SECReport10K and SECReport10Q.
</p>
<p>
    Taking a look at $[SECReport8K,T:QuantConnect.Common.Data.Custom.SEC.SECReport8K], we can see that there is a field that contains a type called $[SECReportSubmission,T:QuantConnect.Common.Data.Custom.SEC.SECReportSubmission].
    It is the class containing all SEC metadata and document contents. To begin accessing SEC data, you'll need to retrieve your SECReport8K, SECReport10K, SECReport10Q, etc. from 
    the Slice object, and then access the "Report" field:

    <div class="section-example-container">
    	<pre class="csharp">
public void OnData(Slice slice)
{
    // ...
    // Save in two different variables in the case that we need to access the Symbol object
    var reportData = slice[_symbol];
    var report = reportData.Report;
}
        </pre>
    	<pre class="python">
def OnData(slice):
    # ...
    # Save in two different variables in the case that we need to access the Symbol object
    reportData = slice[self.symbol]
    report = reportData.Report
        </pre>
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    For $[SECReportSubmission,T:QuantConnect.Common.Data.Custom.SEC.SECReportSubmission], we describe subtle behaviors present for each field:

    <table class="table qc-table table-striped">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <td style="font-weight: bold">Field</td>
                <td style="font-weight: bold">Remarks</td>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>AccessionNumber</td>
                <td>Rarely used, mostly as a way to reference the specific original filing on EDGAR</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>FormType</td>
                <td>Value is hyphenated</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>PublicDocumentCount</td>
                <td>Chosen as string because of potential non-number values</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Period</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Items</td>
                <td>Items are a good way to identify what kind of contents an 8-K report contains</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>FilingDate</td>
                <td>This is sometimes before the date that the data was released on</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>FilingDateChange</td>
                <td>Optional field. Does not always appear in reports. Check for 0001-01-01 to filter</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>MadeAvailableAt</td>
                <td>This is a field added by QuantConnect to identify when the data first became available for reality modeling purposes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Filers</td>
                <td>First filer is usually the company the report is for. Will always contain at least a single value</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Documents</td>
                <td>Will always contain at least a single value</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    Focusing on the SEC report contents, we can access the document(s) by iterating on the Documents field.
    Inside the $[SECReportDocument,T:QuantConnect.Common.Data.Custom.SEC.SECReportDocument] object, the Text field
    contains all of the raw report contents.
