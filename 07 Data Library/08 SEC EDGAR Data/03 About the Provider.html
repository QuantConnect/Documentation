    The United States' Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been operating since 1933.
    Under the Securities Act of 1934, public companies are required to file reports
    that inform investors about a company's financial records and other important investor notices.

    The Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system is the primary vessel in which the
    SEC publishes financial reports to the public. EDGAR makes it easy to search for a company based on CIK or ticker.
    The system contains data starting from 1995-09-15 until today and is still in use by the SEC.
