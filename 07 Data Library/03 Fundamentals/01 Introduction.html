<p>QuantConnect provides Morningstar® corporate fundamentals data for US Equities symbols. Morningstar Data for equities is used by many leading asset management firms, media companies, broker-dealers, and other large institutions to support internal research functions, power investment tools, and deliver meaningful information and analysis to investors.</p> 
<p>For older symbols, the file date is approximated 45 days after the as of date. When a filing date is present on the Morningstar data, it is used.</p>
<p>As we are a quant platform, all the data is loaded using "As Original Reported" figures. If there was a mistake reporting the figure this will not be fixed later. The market typically responds quickly to these initially reported figures. Data is available for multiple periods depending on the property. Periods available include: 1 mo, 2 mo, 3 mo, 6 mo, 9 mo, 12 mo, 1 Yr, 2 Yr, 3 Yr, and 5 Yr.</p>
<p>Morningstar symbols cover the NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX, and BATS exchanges.</p>
<p>In live trading, Morningstar data is delivered to your algorithm at approximately 6 am each day. The majority of the fundamental data update occurs once per month. This includes updates to all of the key information for each security Morningstar supports. On top of this monthly update, there are daily updates of the financial ratios.</p>
<p>As Morningstar data arrives, it updates the master copy and is passed into your algorithm, similar to how TradeBars are fill-forwarded in your data feed. If there have been no updates this week, you'll receive the same fundamental data.</p>
