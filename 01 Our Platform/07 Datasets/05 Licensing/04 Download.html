<p>If you have a Download license, you can store datasets on your local machine. The cost of the license depends on the dataset and it's calculated on a per-file or per-day basis. You must pay for the Download license with your organization's QuantConnect Credit and you need the <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/getting-started/lean-cli'>CLI set up</a> to download datasets. Follow these steps to generate commands to download datasets:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open the <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/datasets/navigating-the-market#02-View-All-Listings'>listing page of the dataset</a> that you want to download.</li>
    <li>Click the <span class='tab-name'>CLI</span> tab.</li>
    <li>Fill in the Command Line Generator form.</li>
    <li>Select <span class='button-name'>Windows</span> or <span class='button-name'>Unix</span>.</li>
    <p>The CLI command to download the dataset displays.</p>
</ol>

<p>To keep your local files up to date, you'll need to download the new files whenever new data becomes available.</p>
