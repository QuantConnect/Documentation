    QuantConnect supports paper trading your strategies. This is running live, real-time data through your algorithm but executing with fictional capital.
</p>

<p>
Paper trading is possible using your brokerage (IB, OANDA) or the QuantConnect "Paper Brokerage Model". The QuantConnect Paper Model allows you to simulate immediate brokerage fills like backtesting without first signing up to a brokerage account. Interactive Brokers supports paper trading by entering paper trading credentials, while other brokerages require selecting different API endpoints on deploying your algorithm.

    <i>QuantConnect Paper Brokerage Model</i> deployments are automatically started with $100,000 starting capital, and the project capital is saved between deployments of the same project.
    To reset your starting capital, select the "Clone Project" button from the project menu and deploy it to live. Currently, there is no way to configure the starting capital for the project. This service is included with a QuantConnect subscription.
