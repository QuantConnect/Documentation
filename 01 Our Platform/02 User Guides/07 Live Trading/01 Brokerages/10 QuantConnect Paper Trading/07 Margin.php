<p>We model buying power and margin calls to ensure your algorithm stays within the margin requirements. If you set the brokerage model to a different model, the new brokerage model defines how margin is modeled.</p>

<h4>Buying Power</h4>
<p>The <code>DefaultBrokerageModel</code> allows up to 2x leverage for Equity trades and up to 50x leverage for Forex trades from margin accounts.</p>
