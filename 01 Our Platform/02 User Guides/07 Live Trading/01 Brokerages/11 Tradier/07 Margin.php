<p>We model buying power and margin calls to ensure your algorithm stays within the margin requirements.</p>

<h4>Buying Power</h4>
<p>In the US, Tradier allows up to 2x leverage on Equity trades for margin accounts. In other countries, Tradier may offer different amounts of leverage. To figure out how much leverage you can access, check with your local legislation or contact a Tradier representative. We model the US version of Tradier leverage by default.</p>
