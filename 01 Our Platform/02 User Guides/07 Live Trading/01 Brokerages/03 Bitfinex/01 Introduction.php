<p>Bitfinex was founded by Giancarlo Devasini and Raphael Nicolle in 2012 with the goal to "give our users the ultimate cryptocurrency trading experience". Bitfinex provides access to trading Crypto for clients outside <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.bitfinex.com/legal/exchange/terms">prohibited jurisdictions</a> with no minimum deposit to set up an account. If you fund your account with fiat currency, they enforce a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://support.bitfinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023357574-Bank-Wire-Deposit-">10,000 minimum</a> for USD, EUR, and GBP. However, if you fund your account with Crypto, they do not enforce a minimum deposit. Bitfinex also provides Crypto staking, a mobile app, and an unrealized profit leaderboard for the traders on the platform. Bitfinex has always been at the forefront of technological innovation in digital asset trading.
