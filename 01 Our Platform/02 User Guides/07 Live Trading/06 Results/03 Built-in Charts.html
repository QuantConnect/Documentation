<p>The Strategy Equity chart displays the following series:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Equity</span>: The live equity curve of your algorithm.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Out of Sample Backtest</span>: The backtest equity curve of your algorithm during the live trading period.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Meta</span>: Points in time when you deployed your algorithm, stopped your algorithm, and when your algorithm encountered a runtime error.</li>
</ul>
