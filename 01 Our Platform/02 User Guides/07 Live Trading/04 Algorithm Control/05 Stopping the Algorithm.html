<p>The live trading performance page has a <span class='button-name'>Stop</span> button to immediately stop your algorithm from executing. Stop your algorithm if you want to perform any of the following actions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Stop trading the strategy</li>
    <li>Update the code files</li>
    <li>Deposit or withdraw capital from your brokerage account</li>
    <li>Update the settings that you entered into the deployment wizard</li>
</ul>

<p>Lean does not synchronize your positions while the algorithm is running, so avoid logging into your brokerage account to place manual orders while your algorithm is running. If you need to adjust your brokerage account, stop the algorithm, adjust your brokerage account, and then redeploy the algorithm.</p>
