<p>Algorithms usually perform differently between backtesting and live trading over the same time period. The discrepancy, known as <span class='new-term'>reconciliation</span>, occurs because backtests are simulations where we try to model reality as close as possible, but the modeling isn't always perfect. We run an out-of-sample (OSS) backtest in parallel to all of your live trading deployments. The <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/live-trading/results">live performance page</a> displays the live equity curve and the OOS backtest equity curve of your algorithms.</p>

<p>If your algorithm is perfectly reconciled, it has an exact overlap between its live and OOS backtest equity curves. Deviations means that the performance of your algorithm has differed between the two execution modes. Several factors can contribute to the deviations. This page explains how we can quantify the deviations and why they occur.</p>
