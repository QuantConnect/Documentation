<p>Strategy risk is the risk that results from designing a strategy based on a statistical model. If you ignore the underlying assumptions of the statistical model, you are exposed to strategy risk. Even if you test that the model assumptions are held, if the market environment changes, the new environment may violate the underlying assumptions of the model after you have deployed it to live trading. Additionally, your strategy development process may be prone to overfitting, survivorship bias, or look-ahead bias, which increases your exposure to strategy risk. To address strategy risk, use rolling parameters when training your statistical models and perform the required statistical tests before training such models. </p>
