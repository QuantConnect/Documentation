<p>The US Equity data feed is a stream of security trades, quotes, and corporate actions delivered to your trading algorithm during live execution. You need live data feeds to inject data into your algorithm so that you can make real-time trading decisions and so that the values of the securities in your portfolio are updated. For instance, if you're trading US Equities, your position values will usually be read from your brokerage account when you deploy the algorithm, but your position values can only be updated as the algorithm progresses if you have a US Equities data feed.</p>
