<h4>**Differences from Backtesting Data Feed </h4>

<p>If you backtest your algorithm and run it live during the same time period, you may receive different data. If the data is different, the consolidators, indicators, and machine learning models in your algorithms may produce different results between backtesting and live trading.</p>

<h4>Bar Adjustments</h4>
<p>In live trading, the opening and closing prices of bars are the prices of the first and last trade that occurred in the time period of the bar, respectively. In backtesting, we adjust the opening and closing price of bars to reflect the official daily opening and closing auction prices, respectively.<br></p>

<h4>Tick Adjustments</h4>
<p>In live trading, ticks are collected into slices that span up to 70 milliseconds before they are injected into your algorithm. The live trading ticks are timestamped with microsecond resolution. In backtesting, ticks are collected into slices that span 1 millisecond before they are injected into your algorithm. The backtesting ticks are timestamped with millisecond resolution.<br></p>
