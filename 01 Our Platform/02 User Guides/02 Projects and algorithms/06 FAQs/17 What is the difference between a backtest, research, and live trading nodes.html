<p>A backtesting node is needed for backtesting trading strategies. Adding more backtesting nodes allows you to run more concurrent backtests. Depending on the design of your algorithm, you can add more powerful nodes to run faster backtests. Nodes with more RAM allocation can handle more intensive operations such as machine learning and options data processing.</p>

<p>A research node is needed to use the research environment. More powerful research nodes allow you to handle more data and run faster computations in your notebooks.</p> 

<p>A live trading node is needed for each live algorithm the organization deploys. More powerful live trading nodes allow you to run algorithms with larger universes, increase your notifications limit, and train machine learning models for a longer period of time.</p>
