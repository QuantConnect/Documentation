<p>Once a backtest has completed, you can share the backtest results and the project files by attaching the backtest to a post in the community forum. To share the backtest results and the project files elsewhere, you need to explicitly make the backtest public in the backtest view page. Once a backtest is made public, a link is generated for you that opens the backtest results and the project files in the browser. You can give the link to whomever you wish to share with. Alternatively, a second link is generated for you to embed a widget of the backtest results and the project files into a website.</p>
