<p>Auctions are run for Alphas that have no allocations remaining. The auctions are processed on the last day of each month. When auctions are processed, the bids in the Alpha order book are accepted in descending order based on the bid price. If you have a subscription for an Alpha and you are outbid in the auction, you lose your subscription. The auctions are necessary to fairly allocate lots to investors when an Alpha has reached its <a href='#02-Capacity'>capacity limit</a>.</p>
