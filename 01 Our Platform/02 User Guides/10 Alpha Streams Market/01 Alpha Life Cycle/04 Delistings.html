<p>Alphas can be removed from the Alpha Streams Market after their 3 month grace period if any of the following circumstances occur:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="../live-trading/reconciliation">Dynamic Time Warping distance</a> &gt; 40%</li>
    <li><a href="../live-trading/reconciliation">Return correlation</a> &lt; .5</li>
    <li>Sharpe ratio &lt; -3</li>
    <li>A logic error occurs and the Author doesn't fix it</li>
    <p>In this case, we temporarily hide the Alpha from the market until the Author fixes the error.</p>
    <li>A runtime error occurs and the Author doesn't fix it</li>
    <p>In this case, we contact the Author to help them fix the runtime error so that they can keep the Alpha listed in the market.</p>
</ul>

<p>If Licensees are invested in an Alpha that passes the metrics above to be delisted, we contact them instead of immediately delisting the Alpha.</p>
