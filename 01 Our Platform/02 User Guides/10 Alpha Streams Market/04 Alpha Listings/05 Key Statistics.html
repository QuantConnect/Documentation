<p>The <span class='page-section-name'>Key Statistics</span> section displays the following metrics of the Alpha's performance:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Days Live</span>: The number of days the algorithm has been live on QuantConnect.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Sharpe Ratio</span>:  The Sharpe Ratio of the Alpha's live and backtest performance.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Return Correlation</span>: The correlation of daily returns between the live and <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/live-trading/reconciliation'>out-of-sample backtest</a> periods.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Dynamic Time Warp</span>: The Dynamic Time Warp between the live and out-of-sample backtest periods.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Probabilistic SR</span>: The <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/optimization/objectives#05-PSR">Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio</a> of the Alpha's backtest and live performance.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Market</span>: The asset classes that the Alpha trades.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Drawdown</span>: The largest peak to trough decline in the Alpha's equity curve during the backtest and live trading periods.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>CAGR</span>: The <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/optimization/objectives#02-CAGR">cumulative annual growth rate</a> of the Alpha during the backtest and live trading periods.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Turnover</span>: The percentage of the Alpha's portfolio that has been replaced in a given year.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Score</span>: The score is calculated as</li>
    <img class='docs-image' src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/score-formula.png">
    <p>A higher score represents a high-performing, realistic algorithm.</p>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Information Ratio</span>: The information Ratio of the Alpha's backtest and live performance.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Trades per Day</span>: The total number of trades during the Alpha's live trading period divided by the number of days the algorithm has been live on QuantConnect. Trades per day is an approximation of the Alpha's trading frequency.</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Capital Requirement</span>: The minimum allocation size that you need to license from the Alpha in order to deploy it with real money. If you license less than the capital requirement, you can only deploy the Alpha with a paper trading account.</li>
