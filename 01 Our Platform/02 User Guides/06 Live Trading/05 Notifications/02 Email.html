<p>Enter an email address, subject, and body into the deployment wizard to set up email notifications. These notifications are rate-limited to 20 messages per hour. The message body can only include up to 10KB of text content. Email notifications can be slow since they go through your email provider. If you don't receive an email notification that you're expecting, check your junk folders. If you manually send an email notification, you must provide a message for the body of the email and you can provide an attachment and headers.</p>

    <pre class="python">self.Notify.Email(email_address, subject, body, attachment, headers)</pre>
