<p>Market risk, also known as systematic risk, is the risk that the value of your portfolio will decrease due to the value of the entire market decreasing. Market risk is caused by changes in interest rates, changes in currency exchange rates, geopolitical events, natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks, and economic recessions. Additionally, central bank announcements and changes to monetary policy can increase overall market volatility and market risk. To address market risk, you can increase diversification, reduce your portfolio beta, hedge your positions with put Options, or hedge against volatility with volatility index securities.</p>
