<div>What is the cost:</div><div>-Optimization is paid for in QCC from your organization</div><div>-The cost is calculated after you run a backtest for the strategy</div><div>-Using the last run backtest, the optimization search model selected and 
the number
                 of parameters, QuantConnect can create a rough estimate
 of the total time it will take to run this optimization. 
                 You can speed up this optimization by assigning it more
 processing nodes, or depending on your
                  algorithm making sure it has sufficient CPU available.
 Note: There is a spin up time of roughly
                   15s on each backtest so even very short backtests can
 sometimes take some time to process.</div><div>-Optimization nodes are rented on a time-basis</div><div>-Using multiple nodes makes the optimization run faster but doesn't really cost more because each of the nodes are used for a shorter period of time</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - It may cost more when you factor in the spin-up time of each of the nodes</div><div><br></div><div>Why do I have to pay:</div><div>- QC provides convenience by providing the hardware and platform</div><div>- If you have your own hardware, you can run local optimizations with local data and local hardware without paying QCC<br></div><div></div>
