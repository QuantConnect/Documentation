<p>The Sharpe ratio measures the excess returns relative to a benchmark, divided by the standard deviation of those returns. The Sharpe ratio is calculated as</p>

<p>where <i>R<sub>a</sub></i> is the returns of your algorithm, <i>R<sub>b</sub></i> is the returns of the benchmark, and <i>σ<sub>a</sub></i> is the standard deviation of your algorithm's excess returns. By default, Lean uses a 0% risk-free rate, so <i>R<sub>b</sub> = 0</i>. The benefit of using the Sharpe ratio as the objective is that it maximizes returns while minimizing the return volatility. It is usually easier to keep a live algorithm deployed if it has minimal swings in equity than if it has large swings in equity. The drawback of using Sharpe ratio is that it may limit your potential returns in favor of a less volatile equity curve.</p>
