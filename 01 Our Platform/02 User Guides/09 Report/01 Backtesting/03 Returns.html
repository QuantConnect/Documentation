<p>The backtest report displays charts to show the algorithm's returns per trade, per day, per month, per year, and the cumulative returns over the backtest.<br></p>

<h4>Returns per Trade</h4>

<p>This chart displays a histogram that shows the distribution of returns per trade over the backtesting period.</p>

<h4>Daily Returns</h4>

<p>This chart displays the returns of each day. Blue bars represent profitable days and gray bars represent unprofitable days.</p>

<h4>Monthly Returns</h4>
<img src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/monthly-returns-chart.png" class="docs-image">
<p>This chart displays the return of each month. We convert the original equity curve series into a monthly series and calculate the returns of each month. Green cells represent months with a positive return and red cells represent months with a negative return. Months that have a greater magnitude of returns are represented with darker cells. Yellow cells represent months with a relatively small gain or loss. White rectangles represent months that are not included in the backtest period. The values in the cells are percentages.</p>

<h4>Annual Returns</h4>

<p>
    This chart displays the return of each year.
    We calculate the total return within each year and represent each year with a blue bar.
    The red dotted line represents the average of the annual returns.
</p>

<h4>Cumulative Returns</h4>

<p>
    This chart displays the cumulative returns of your algorithm. The blue line represents your algorithm and the gray line represents the benchmark.
