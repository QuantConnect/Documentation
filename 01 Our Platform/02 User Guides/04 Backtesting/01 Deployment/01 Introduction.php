<p>Deploy a backtest to simulate your trading algorithm on our cloud servers. Since the same Lean engine is used to run backtests and live trading algorithms, it's easy to transition from backtesting to live trading once you are satisfied with the historical performance of your algorithm. If you find any issues with Lean, the historical data, or the website when running backtests, we'll resolve the issue.</p>
