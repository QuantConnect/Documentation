<p>Projects consist of code files, notebook files, and directories. Code files can contain up to 64,000 characters. The limit is in place to encourage you to split up project files into modular components. If you have files with more than 64,000 characters, separate the content into multiple files. Notebook files can be up to 128KB in size. The limit is in place because notebooks won't save when they exceed the limit. If your notebook file exceeds the limit, move the code in the notebook to a code file in the project and then import the code file into the notebook. Alternatively, if the code or notebook file contains data instead of code, import the data from a custom data source or read the data from the ObjectStore.</p>
