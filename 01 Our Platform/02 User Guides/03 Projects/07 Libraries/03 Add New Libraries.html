<p>To request a new library, <a href="/contact">contact us</a>. We will add the library to the queue for review and deployment. Since the libraries run on our servers, we need to ensure they are secure and won't cause harm. The process of adding new libraries takes 2-4 weeks to complete. View the list of libraries currently under review on the <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alibrary-request">Issues list of the Lean GitHub repository</a>.</p>
