<p>Libraries are third-party software repositories that you can use in your projects. You can use many of the available open-source libraries to complement the classes and methods that you create. Libraries reduce your development time because it's faster to use a pre-built, open-source library than to write the functionality. Libraries can be used in backtesting, research, and live trading. To use these libraries, add the relevant <code class="csharp">using</code><code class="python">import</code> statement at the top of your file.<br></p>
