<p>The optimization results page displays a Server Statistics section to show the status of the <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/optimization/deployment#02-Resources'>nodes</a> running the optimization job.</p>

<img class='docs-image' src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/optimization-server-statistics.png">

<p>The following table describes the information that the Server Statistics section displays:</p>

<table class="table qc-table">

        <tr>
            <td>CPU</td>
            <td>The total CPU usage and the CPU usage of each node</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>RAM</td>
            <td>The total RAM usage of the RAM usage of each node</td>

            <td>HOST</td>
            <td>The node model and the number of nodes used to run the optimization</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Uptime</td>
            <td>The length of time that the optimization job has ran</td>
