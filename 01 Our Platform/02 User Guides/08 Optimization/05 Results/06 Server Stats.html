<p>The Server Statistics section displays the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>CPU</span>: CPU usage of each node</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>RAM</span>: RAM usage of each node</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>HOST</span>: Node type and quantity</li>
    <li><span class='ul-option'>Uptime</span>: The length of time that the optimization job has ran</li>
</ul>

<p>View the Server Statistics section to see the amount of CPU power and RAM the optimization job demands. If your algorithm is demanding a lot of resources, use more powerful nodes on the next optimization job or improve the efficiency of your algorithm.</p>
