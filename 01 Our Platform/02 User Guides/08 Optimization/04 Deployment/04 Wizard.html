<p>The Optimization Wizard lets you select the optimization parameters, objectives, strategy, constraints, and nodes. Follow the point-and-click process of the wizard to <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/optimization/running-optimizations'>launch optimizations jobs</a> in the same location where you perform research and write algorithms. After you launch an optimization job, the <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/optimization/results'>optimization results page</a> automatically displays and is updated in real-time as the optimization nodes backtest your algorithm. You can close or refresh the window without interrupting the optimization job because the nodes are processing on our servers.</p>
