<p>Concurrent backtesting is the process of running multiple backtests at the same time within a single organization. Concurrent backtesting speeds up your strategy development because you don't have to wait while a single backtest finishes executing. You need multiple backtesting nodes in your organization to run concurrent backtests. The more backtesting nodes that your organization has, the more concurrent backtests you can execute. If you are trying to fine-tune your <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/projects/structure#06-Parameters">parameters</a>, consider running a <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/optimization">parameter optimization</a>. If you run a parameter optimization job, you can run multiple backtests concurrently without having multiple backtest nodes.<br></p>

<p>The number of backtesting nodes that you can have in your organization depends on the tier of your organization. The following table shows the backtesting node quotas:</p>
