<!--<p>The community is a great resource for support on developing algorithms. However, for more personalized assistance and privacy, you can submit a request for support from a QuantConnect engineer. In order for a member of your organization to submit a support ticket, they must have a support seat. You can add support seats in the Support tab inside the Algorithm Lab. Premium support allows sharing the algorithm with IP protection and enables the Support Team to address issues with live algorithms.</p>
