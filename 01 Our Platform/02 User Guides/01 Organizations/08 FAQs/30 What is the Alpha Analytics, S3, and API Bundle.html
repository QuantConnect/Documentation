<p>The Alpha Analytics, S3, and API Bundle enables you to perform automated bulk alpha research, licensing, and correlation analysis. With this bundle, you can collect the insights from the alphas you have licensed from the Alpha Market and process them however you want. Without this bundle, you need one brokerage account for every alpha you want to license and trade from the Alpha Market.</p>
