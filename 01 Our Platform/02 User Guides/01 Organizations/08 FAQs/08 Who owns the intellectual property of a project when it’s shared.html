<p>All individuals on QuantConnect own their intellectual property (IP) on our platform. Your code is private and only accessible by people you share the project with or by support-engineers when you submit a support ticket. At no point does QuantConnect ever claim ownership of user IP. The only case where algorithm code becomes public domain is when they are shared to the forum. In this case, algorithms need to be made public domain to allow the sharing of the algorithm code.</p>

<p>The IP rights of a project are reserved for the user who created the project. For Team organizations, collaborators can clone the project, but the original project belongs to the person who first created it. For Trading Firm and Institution organizations, the organization owns all of the projects within the organization even after collaborating with external consultants.</p>
