<p>You can spend some QCC to download <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/datasets">datasets</a> from the Dataset Market to your local machine. The cost of downloading depends on the dataset and it's calculated on a per-file or per-day basis. To download datasets, <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/getting-started/lean-cli">set up the CLI</a> and then <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/datasets/purchasing-datasets#04-Generate-Download-Command">generate a download command</a> from the dataset listing. To keep your local files up to date, you'll need to download the new files whenever new data becomes available.</p>
