<p>The API Tree is a panel in the IDE that describes all of the members of the <code>QCAlgorithm</code> class. The type and description are included for class attributes. The description, argument types, argument names, and return type are included for class methods. The API Tree uses two icons to distinguish between class properties and methods:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Wrench</b>: Property</li>
    <li><b>Cube</b>: Method</li>

</ul>

<p>Use the API Tree to increase your development speed. You can find which class members you have available to use and what arguments they may expect without needing to reference the documentation.</p>
