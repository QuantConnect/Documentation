<p>Coding errors are errors that cause your projects to not build, throw exceptions, or behave unexpectedly. There are generally 3 types of coding errors: build, runtime, and logic errors. Each type of error occurs for different reasons.<br></p>
<h4>Build Errors</h4>
<p>Build errors occur when the interpreter's syntax check fails. An example code snippet that produces a build error is the following:</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
   <pre class="csharp">var a = 1;
if (a = 2) {}</pre>
   <pre class="python">a = 1
if a = 2:
    pass</pre>
</div>
<p>If build errors occur in your project, you can not use the debugger, logging statements, or custom charts to debug the issue. You're notified of build errors in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The line where the error occurs is underlined in red.</li>
    <li>The Problems panel at the bottom of the IDE displays the errors.</li>
    <li>The Explorer panel highlights the editors, files, and outlines in red where the error occurs.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Runtime Errors</h4>
<p>Runtime Errors, also called exceptions, occur when the interpreter’s syntax checks pass but an error occurs during execution. An example code snippet that produces a runtime error is the following:<br></p>
<div class="section-example-container">
   <pre class="csharp">var a = new List&lt;int&gt;<int>() {1};
var b = a[1];</int></pre>
   <pre class="python">a = [1]
a[1]</pre>
</div>
<p>If runtime errors occur in your project, a stack trace of the error is added to the Cloud Terminal and the log file. For example, the snippet above produces the following error message:</p>
<div class="python error-messages">
   Runtime Error: IndexError : list index out of range<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;at OnData<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a[1]<br>
   ===<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at Python.Runtime.PyObject.Invoke(PyTuple args in main.py: line 17<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Open Stack Trace)
</div>
<div class="csharp error-messages">
   Runtime Error: Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection. (Parameter 'index') in Main.cs:line 24	 (Open Stack Trace)
</div>
<p>The stack trace from the build error identifies the line of code where the error occurs. If the error doesn't reference your project files, it's an issue with Lean or another library. To view more information about the error, click <span class='button-name'>(Open Stack Trace)</span>.</p>
<h4>Logic Errors</h4>
<p>Logic errors occur when your algorithm behaves in an unexpected or unintended manner. These types of errors don't halt the program execution, so they are difficult to diagnose. An example code snippet that produces a logic error is the following:<br></p>
<div class="section-example-container">
   <pre class="csharp">var average = x + y / 2.0; // instead of (x + y) / 2.0</pre>
   <pre class="python">average = x + y / 2 # instead of (x + y) / 2</pre>
</div>
<p>To resolve logic errors, carefully trace your algorithm. You may use the <code>Log</code> and <code>Debug</code> methods or the built-in debugger.</p>
