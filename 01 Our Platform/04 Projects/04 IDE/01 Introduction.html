<p>The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) lets you work on research notebooks and develop algorithms for backtesting and live trading. When you <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/projects/managing-projects#05-Open-Existing-Projects">open a project</a>, the IDE automatically displays. The web IDE enables you to access your trading algorithms from anywhere in the world with just an internet connection and a browser. If you prefer to use a different IDE, the <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli'>CLI</a> allows you to develop locally in your preferred IDE.</p>
