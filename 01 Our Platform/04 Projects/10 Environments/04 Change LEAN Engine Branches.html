<p>Follow these steps to change the Lean engine branch that's used to run your backtests and live trading algorithms:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open the project for which you want to change the Lean engine branch.</li>
    <li>In the Project panel, click the <span class='field-name'>LEAN Engine</span> field and then click a branch from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li><span class='qualifier'>(Optional)</span> Click <span class='button-name'>About Version</span> to display the branch description.</li>
    <li>If you want to always use the master branch, select the <span class='button-name'>Always use Master Branch</span> check box.</li>
    <li>Click <span class='button-name'>Save</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Changing the Lean engine branch only affects the current project. If you <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/projects/project-management#03-Create-Projects'>create a new project</a>, the new project will use the master branch by default.</p>
