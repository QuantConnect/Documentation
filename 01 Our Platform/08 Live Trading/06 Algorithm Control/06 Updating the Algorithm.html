<p>If you need to adjust your algorithm's project files, stop your algorithm, make your changes, and then redeploy your algorithm. You can't adjust your algorithm's code while your algorithm executes.</p>

<p>When you stop and redeploy a live algorithm, your project's live equity curve is retained between the deployments. To erase the equity curve history, clone the project and then redeploy the cloned version of the project.</p>
