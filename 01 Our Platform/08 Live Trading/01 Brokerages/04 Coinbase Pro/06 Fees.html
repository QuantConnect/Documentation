<p>We model the order fees of Coinbase Pro at the $50K-100K pricing tier for all Crypto pairs, which is a 0.5% maker and taker fee. If you add liquidity to the order book by placing a limit order that doesn't cross the spread, you pay maker fees. If you remove liquidity from the order book by placing an order that crosses the spread, you pay taker fees. Coinbase Pro adjusts your fees based on your 30-day trading volume, but we don't currently model trading volume to adjust fees.</p>

<p>We model the adjustments Coinbase Pro has made to their fees over time. The following table shows the fees for each time period:</p>
