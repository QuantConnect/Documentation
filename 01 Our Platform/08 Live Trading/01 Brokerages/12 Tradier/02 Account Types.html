<h4>Create an Account</h4>
<p>Follow the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://onboarding.tradier.com/signup">account creation wizard</a> on the Tradier website to create a Tradier account.</p>

<p>You will need your account ID and access token to deploy live algorithms. After you have an account, get your account ID and token from the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="menu-name" href="https://dash.tradier.com/settings/api">Settings &gt; API Access</a> page on the Tradier website. Your account ID is the alpha-numeric code in a drop-down field on the page.</p>

<h4>Paper Trading</h4>
<p>Tradier supports paper trading with the following caveats:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Account activity is unavailable since this information is populated from Tradier's clearing firm.</li>
    <li>Streaming Tradier market data is unavailable due to exchange restrictions related to delayed data.</li>
</ul>

<p>To get your paper trading account number and access token, open the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="dash.tradier.com/settings/api">API Access</a> page on the Tradier website and then scroll down to the <span class="page-section-name">Sandbox Account Access (Paper Trading)</span> section.</p>

<p>If you trade Equities, you can use the <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/data-feeds/us-equities">QuantConnect data feed</a> to get real-time data. If you trade Options, you must use delayed data from the <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/data-feeds/brokerage-data-feeds/tradier">Tradier data feed</a>. If you trade Equities and Options, use the Tradier data feed. We don't currently have a hybrid QuantConnect-Tradier data feed.</p>
