<p>The <span class='tab-name'>Logs</span> tab on the live results page displays all of the <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/projects/debugging#04-Logging-Statements'>logging statements</a> and status messages your algorithm creates. The status messages include all of the points in time when your algorithm deployed, encountered an error, sent an order, or quit executing. It's good practice to add logs in live algorithms because then you can see what is happening while it executes. If you stop and redeploy your algorithm, the logs are retained. You can view the log file on the live results page or download them to your local machine. </p>
