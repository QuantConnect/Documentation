<p>The content in the live results page updates as your algorithm executes. You can close or refresh the window without interrupting the algorithm because the live trading node processes on our servers. If you close the page, you can <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/results#12-View-All-Live-Projects'>view all of your live projects</a> to open the page again.</p>
