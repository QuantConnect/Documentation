<p>The Free tier provides cloud access to datasets for all of the asset classes in our <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/datasets'>Datasets Market</a>. The free data ranges from minute to daily resolutions and can be used to either run backtests or perform analysis in the <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/research-environment'>Research Environment</a>. When backtesting, Free organizations have access to our built-in auto-complete and debugging features in the web IDE. After a successful backtest, Free organizations can use our report generator to create professional-grade <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/report'>reports</a> that reflect their backtest performance. In terms of education, Free organizations have access to our online documentation, community forum, YouTube channel, and Learning Center.</p>
