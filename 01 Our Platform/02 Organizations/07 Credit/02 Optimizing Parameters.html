<p>You need QCC in your organization to unlock <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/optimization">parameter optimization</a>. Parameter optimization jobs use optimization nodes, which are rented on a time basis. Therefore, the longer it takes to run all of the backtests in your optimization job, the more QCC it costs. Before you run optimizations, we estimate on how much QCC it will cost to run the job, but the final cost can differ from our estimates because we can't know exactly how long all of the backtests will take to run ahead of time. For instructions on optimizating parameters, see <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/optimization/deployment#04-Launch-Optimization-Jobs'>Launch Optimization Jobs</a>.</p>
