<p>The community is a great resource for support for developing algorithms. However, for more personalized assistance and privacy, you can <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/organizations/requesting-support#03-Open-New-Tickets">submit support tickets</a> to request assistance from a QuantConnect engineer. Premium support allows you to share your algorithms with IP protection and enables the Support Team to address issues with live algorithms. In order to submit a support ticket, you must have a support seat in your organization.</p>

<p>There are three tiers of support seats and each tier provides different services. You can file support tickets to get private assistance with issues, but support tickets should not replace your efforts of performing your own research and reading through the documentation. If you need further assistance than what our Support Team offers, consider hiring an <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/community/integration-partners'>Integration Partner</a>.</p>
