<p>Your organization's nodes are shared among all of the organization's members to reduce the amount of time that nodes idle. In the Algorithm Lab, you can <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/organizations/resources#10-View-All-Nodes'>see which nodes are available</a> within your organization. By default, the best-performing resource is selected when you run a backtest or launch a research notebook, but you can <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/projects/ide#07-Manage-Nodes'>select a specific resource to use</a>.</p>
