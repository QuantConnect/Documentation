<p>You need <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/organizations/administration#05-Permissions">team removal permission</a> to remove members from your organization. Before removing members, stop all nodes that they are using. Removing members is not reversible and the members will lose access to the organization's projects. On the Team tier, projects that the members created in the organization will remain with the members. On the Trading Firm and Institution tiers, projects that the members created in the organization will be transferred to the organization manager.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to remove members from your organization:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open the <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/tutorials/organizations/managing-team-members#02-View-All-Members">Team Management</a> page.</li>

        <li>Click the <span class='icon-name'>three dots</span> icon in the top-right corner of the member that you want to remove and then click <span class='button-name'>Remove</span>.</li>
