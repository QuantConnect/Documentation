<p>Please follow our community policies.</p>

<h4><span><img src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/check-circle@2x.png" alt="" style="width: 40px;"></span> Respect</h4>
<p>We want our forum to be a place of general respect for one another. Keep interactions constructive, but friendly and lighthearted. Remember — we’re all here to help one another and keep our community strong.</p>

<h4><span><img src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/check-circle@2x.png" alt="" style="width: 40px;"></span> Due Diligence</h4>
<p>We have hundreds of quants posting their questions. Your question is important, but make sure to check a few places before posting. We've worked hard on providing comprehensive documentation and <a href="/learning">bootcamp tutorials</a> — make sure to check there first. Next, try Googling the concept to see if you can get another perspective before posting. Furthermore, our Debugger is a great tool to identify bugs in the code logic.</p>

<h4><span><img src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/check-circle@2x.png" alt="" style="width: 40px;"></span> Relevancy</h4>
<p>Keep posts related to algorithmic trading or quantitative finance.</p>

<h4><span><img src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/check-circle@2x.png" alt="" style="width: 40px;"></span> Patience</h4>
<p>Be patient with the community responses to your questions. Keep in mind the community are volunteers contributing to your quantitative growth voluntarily. When possible, answer your own questions to leave a path for future readers. Avoid "bumps", "+1", "Any Update?", double posting, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/threadjacking">thread hijacking</a>, or <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/necro-bump#English">necro-bumping</a> discussions. Contributions are often rewarded with <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/organizations/credit">QuantConnect Credit</a>.</p>

<h4><span><img src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/x-circle@2x.png" alt="" style="width: 40px;"></span> Bigotry</h4>
<p>QuantConnect is firmly rooted in our policy against bigotry in our community forum. We are vehemently against racist, sexist, xenophobic, homophobic, or otherwise discriminatory behavior in our community. Any language that may offend anyone based on race, sexual orientation, gender, religion, will not be tolerated.</p>

<h4><span><img src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/x-circle@2x.png" alt="" style="width: 40px;"></span> Harassment</h4>
<p>Bullying is not a part of our core culture at QuantConnect. We do not tolerate bullying, sexual harassment, profanity, threats of violence or otherwise, or any sexual harassment in our community forum.</p>

<h4><span><img src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/x-circle@2x.png" alt="" style="width: 40px;"></span> Bug Reports / Data Issues</h4>
<p>We request bug reports be sent to the <a href="/contact">Support Team</a>. The forums are not an effective bug tracking tool and often the reported issue is simply confusion on how the platform operates. For data issues please report the specific dates, times, contracts, and type of issue to the <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/datasets/data-issues#04-Report-New-Issues">Data Explorer Issues List</a>. This is a system we've designed to track, fix and notify users when issues are fixed.</p>

<h4><span><img src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/x-circle@2x.png" alt="" style="width: 40px;"></span> Promotional Activity</h4>
<p>Spam and other forms of promotional activity isn't permitted in the community forum. Posts that deliver immediate value to the readers are permitted such as sharing a well-performing algorithm with an attribution to the author's company in the code comments.</p>

Can Someone Make My Algorithm?</h4>
<p>We understand people are at different stages of their quant-growth, but if you are soliciting assistance you should have completed <a href="/learning">Boot Camp</a>, and attach a backtest or code snippet with your best attempt at building your algorithm. This shows respect for the reader's time. You will need to know how to code to use QuantConnect.</p>
