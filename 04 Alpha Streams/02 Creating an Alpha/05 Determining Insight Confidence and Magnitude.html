To maximize the compatibility and use of an Alpha Model, it should populate as many fields as possible. As the author, you should put some thought into the abstract, relatively artistic properties of an Insight.</p><h4>Insight Period</h4><p> How long do you expect the signal to last? Can you use any information from the data you're consuming to build a theory on the Insight timeframe? Although tricky questions with some creative thought you can likely estimate this field. High-frequency strategies generate short insights, where foundational moves in the economy produce much longer predictions.</p><h4>Insight Magnitude</h4><p>What is the expected return from your Insight? Will this data cause a large change in the asset price within the time-frame you are specifying? The Insight magnitude indicates how tradable the signal is for the Fund. The price movement, combined with the asset volume give the depth of the signal and an estimate of how much capital can be deployed to your Alpha.</p><h4>Insight Confidence</h4><p>How strong is your signal? Some Portfolio Construction techniques such as Black Litterman allow using the confidence of the signal as a factor in the allocation. When applicable include Confidence in your Alpha Model, this way consumers can factor in this into their decision.</p>
