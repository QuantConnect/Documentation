An Alpha is an algorithm that generates expected return predictions funds can use to help manage their portfolio. Alphas solely focus on this prediction, actively ignoring position sizing and management. Fund managers with existing portfolios prefer to consume your signals as a factor to their model. To see more about creating an Alpha for the marketplace, see the next section, <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/alpha-streams/creating-an-alpha">Creating An Alpha</a>
</p>

<p>
Some examples of a focused alpha model are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>"Profitability Alpha" - Company profitability as a signal of its upward motion.</li>
	<li>"Public Sentiment Alpha" - Public opinion as an indicator of company trajectory.</li>
	<li>"Product Demand Alpha" - Tracking sales to project the trajectory of a company.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Your alpha <i>does not need to perform well in all markets</i> to be a good alpha. The fund consuming the alpha will need to decide when to apply your signal. In fact, the more focused your alpha is, the more widely applicable it will be to potential clients.
