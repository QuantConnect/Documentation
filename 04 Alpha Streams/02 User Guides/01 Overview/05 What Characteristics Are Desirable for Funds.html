Every fund is looking for unique characteristics. Some are looking to extend their portfolio for new uncorrelated markets, while others are looking for hedges to derisk their holdings. Others may be taking a broad spectrum approach and licensing algorithms to get a sense of the community. As the Alpha Streams market grows, there will be more and more buyers for your algorithm. Generally speaking, you should not design an Alpha for a specific fund, but just explore topics you find interesting.
</p><p>Your Alpha should focus on a single investment thesis. It can be tempting to make an Alpha performance "perfect," overfitting to past scenarios. However, if you factor in multiple environmental conditions, the funds may see it as overfitting your strategy. </p>
<p>Do not worry if the performance isn't perfect for all market conditions - it is up to the funds consuming your alpha to combine Alphas to make a single portfolio strategy. As such, there are no performance requirements for Alphas. Some algorithms perform well over time; others perform well seasonally. We believe any performance judgment by QuantConnect would infer a selection bias on the resulting marketplace.
