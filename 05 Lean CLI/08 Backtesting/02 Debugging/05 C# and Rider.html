    Follow these steps to start local debugging for C# in Rider:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Follow the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/projects/autocomplete#05-C-and-Rider">How to set up local autocomplete for C# in Rider</a> tutorial.</li>
    <li>Open the project containing the <span class='public-file-name'>Main.cs</span> file in a new Rider window. It is important that you open the project directory itself, not your <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/initialization/organization-workspaces'>organization workspace</a>.</li>
    <li>Run the <code>lean backtest</code> command with the <code>--debug rider</code> option and wait until the CLI tells you to attach to the debugger. Remember we recommend you run all <code>lean</code> commands in your organization workspace directory.
<div class="cli section-example-container">
<pre>$ lean backtest "My Project" --debug rider
20210423 13:50:54.634 TRACE:: DebuggerHelper.Initialize(): waiting for debugger to attach...</pre>
</div>
    </li>
    <li>In Rider, select <span class='menu-name'>Run > Attach To Remote Process...</span>.</li>
    <li>In the pop-up that opens, select the target named <span class='button-name'>root@localhost:2222</span>.</li>
    <li>Wait for Rider to connect and select the process named <span class='button-name'>dotnet QuantConnect.Lean.Launcher.dll</span> when a selector pops up to start debugging. You may have to select <span class='box-name'>Remote debugger tools are not loaded to the remote host. Click to load</span> first.</li>
</ol>
