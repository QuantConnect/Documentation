<p>
    Runs the LEAN Report Creator in a Docker container using the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/quantconnect/lean" target="_blank">quantconnect/lean</a> Docker image.
    By default, this command generates a report of the most recent backtest.
    This behavior can be overridden by using <code>--backtest-results &lt;path&gt;</code> and providing the path to the backtest results JSON file.
    If <code>--live-results &lt;path&gt;</code> is also given, the generated report will contain both the backtest and the live results.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>--strategy-name</code>, <code>--strategy-version</code>, and <code>--strategy-description</code> options can be used to set the name, version, and description that are shown in the report.
    The name and version are shown in the top-right corner of each page, while the description is shown on the top of the first page.
    These fields are blank by default.
</p>

<p>
    When the given backtest results are stored in a project directory or one of its subdirectories, the default name is the name of the project directory and the default description is the description in the project's <span class='public-file-name'>config.json</span> file.
</p>

<p>
    By default, the official LEAN engine image is used.
    You can override this using the <code>--image &lt;value&gt;</code> option.
    Alternatively, you can set the default engine image for all commands using <code>lean config set engine-image &lt;value&gt;</code>.
    The image is pulled before running the report creator if it doesn't exist locally yet or if you pass the <code>--update</code> flag.
