    Removes a library from a project.
    This command can remove libraries that are added using <code>lean library add</code>, as well as libraries that were manually added to the C# project file or a Python project's <span class="public-file-name">requirements.txt</span> file.
</p>

<p>C# libraries are removed from your C# project file (the file ending in <span class="public-file-name">.csproj</span>).
    If <code>dotnet</code> is on your <code>PATH</code> and <code>--no-local</code> is not given, the CLI also restores all dependencies using <code>dotnet restore</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Third-party Python libraries are removed from your project's <span class="public-file-name">requirements.txt</span> file.
</p>

<p>Project libraries are removed from your <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/projects/configuration'>project configuration file</a>.</p>
