<p>
    Adds a <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/projects/libraries/third-party-libraries'>third-party</a> or <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/projects/libraries/project-libraries'>project library</a> to a project so you can use it in local backtesting, local live trading, local optimizations, and the local research environment.
    Additionally, this command updates your local environment so you get autocomplete on the libraries.
</p>

<p>
    C# libraries are added to your C# project file (the file ending in <span class='public-file-name'>.csproj</span>).
    If <code>dotnet</code> is on your <code>PATH</code> and <code>--no-local</code> is not given, the CLI also restores all dependencies using <code>dotnet restore</code> to make local autocomplete work.</p>

<p>
    Third-party Python libraries are added to your project's <span class='public-file-name'>requirements.txt</span> file.
    If <code>pip</code> is on your <code>PATH</code> and <code>--no-local</code> is not given, the CLI also installs the Python package in your local Python environment to make local autocomplete work. </p>



<p>
    If <code>--version</code> is not given, the package is pinned to the latest compatible version.
    For C# projects, this is the latest available version.
    For Python projects, this is the latest version compatible with Python 3.8 (which is what the Docker images use).
</p>

<p>
    If <code>--version</code> is given and the project is a Python project, the CLI will additionally check whether the given version is compatible with Python 3.6.
    If this is not the case, the command aborts because libraries incompatible with Python 3.8 cannot be installed in the official Docker images.
</p>

<p>If you add a project library to the project, the name and path of the library is added to the <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/projects/configuration'>project configuration file</a>.</p>
