<p>
    The CLI contains a lot of commands to make working on LEAN algorithms easier and more productive.
    Below we list some of the most common tasks, see the pages in the sidebar and the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/api-reference/lean-init">API reference</a> for a complete overview of the supported features.
</p>

<h4>Authenticate With the Cloud</h4>
<p>
    Before using the CLI to perform tasks in the cloud it is required to log in with your QuantConnect API credentials.
    Run <code>lean login</code> to open an interactive wizard which asks you for your user id and API token.
<a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/community/profile#09-Request-API-Token">Request these credentials</a> and we'll email them to you.</p>

<div class="cli section-example-container">
<pre>$ lean login
Your user id and API token are needed to make authenticated requests to the QuantConnect API
You can request these credentials on https://www.quantconnect.com/account
Both will be saved in /home/&lt;username&gt;/.lean/credentials
User id: &lt;user id&gt;
API token: &lt;api token&gt;
Successfully logged in</pre>
</div>

<h4>Pull Projects From the Cloud</h4>
<p>
    Run <code>lean cloud pull</code> to pull your QuantConnect projects to your local drive.
    This command pulls all your cloud projects to your local drive while preserving your QuantConnect directory structure.
    If you have a lot of projects and only want to work locally on a few of them you can run this command with the <code>--project "&lt;projectName&gt;"</code> option, which makes the command pull a single project instead.
</p>

<div class="cli section-example-container">
<pre>$ lean cloud pull
[1/3] Pulling 'Creative Red Mule'
Successfully pulled 'Creative Red Mule/main.py'
[2/3] Pulling 'Determined Yellow-Green Duck'
Successfully pulled 'Determined Yellow-Green Duck/main.py'
Successfully pulled 'Determined Yellow-Green Duck/research.ipynb'
[3/3] Pulling 'Halloween Strategy'
Successfully pulled 'Halloween Strategy/benchmark.py'
Successfully pulled 'Halloween Strategy/main.py'
Successfully pulled 'Halloween Strategy/research.ipynb'</pre>
</div>

<h4>Source Data</h4>
<p>
    Run <code>lean data generate --start 20180101 --symbol-count 100</code> to generate realistic fake market data to test with.
    You can also choose to <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/datasets/downloading-quantconnect-data">download data</a> from QuantConnect Datasets, or to convert your own data into LEAN-compatible data.
</p>

<div class="cli section-example-container">
<pre>$ lean data generate --start 20180101 --symbol-count 100
Begin data generation of 100 randomly generated Equity assets...
...</pre>
</div>

<h4>Run a Local Backtest</h4>
<p>
    Run <code>lean backtest "&lt;projectName&gt;"</code> to run a local backtest for the specified project.
    This command runs a backtest in a Docker container containing the same packages as the ones used on QuantConnect.com, but with your own data.
</p>

<div class="cli section-example-container">
<pre>$ lean backtest "Project Name"
20210308 23:58:35.354 TRACE:: Engine.Main(): LEAN ALGORITHMIC TRADING ENGINE v2.5.0.0 Mode: DEBUG (64bit)
20210308 23:58:35.360 TRACE:: Engine.Main(): Started 11:58 PM
...</pre>
</div>

<h4>Push Local Changes to the Cloud</h4>
<p>
    Run <code>lean cloud push</code> to push local changes to the QuantConnect.
    This command pushes all your local projects to the cloud and creates new cloud projects when necessary.
    If you only want to push a single project you can run this command with the <code>--project "&lt;projectName&gt;"</code> option.
</p>

<div class="cli section-example-container">
<pre>$ lean cloud push
[1/3] Pushing 'Creative Red Mule'
Successfully updated cloud file 'Creative Red Mule/main.py'
[2/3] Pushing 'Determined Yellow-Green Duck'
[3/3] Pushing 'Halloween Strategy'</pre>
</div>

<h4>Run a Cloud Backtest</h4>
<p>
    Run <code>lean cloud backtest "&lt;projectName&gt;"</code> to run a cloud backtest for the specified project.
    By default, a summary of the results and a link to the full results are shown in the terminal.
    Running this command with the <code>--open</code> flag automatically opens the full results in the browser once the backtest is finished.
    Additionally, you can run this command with the <code>--push</code> flag to push all local changes to the project to the cloud before running the backtest.
</p>

<pre>$ lean cloud backtest "Project Name"
