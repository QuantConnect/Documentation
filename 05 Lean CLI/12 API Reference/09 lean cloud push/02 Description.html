<p>
    Pushes local projects to QuantConnect while preserving the directory structure of your local projects.
    The project's <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/files#02-Supported-File-Types'>supported files</a>, description, and parameters are pushed to the cloud.
    By default, all local projects in your current organization workspace directory are pushed. If you provide a <code>--project</code> option, you only push a single project to the cloud.
</p>

<p>
    Before pushing a local project, the CLI checks if the cloud project with the same path already exists.
    If it does and the cloud project is not linked to the local project (because of an earlier <code>lean cloud pull</code> or <code>lean cloud push</code>), the CLI adds a 1 to the end of the name of your local project and then pushes it to the cloud.
    If the cloud project doesn't exist yet, the CLI creates it for you and pushes the contents of the local project to the newly created cloud project.
</p>

<p>
    If you have a cloud copy of a project when you push it from your local machine, files in the cloud which don't exist locally are deleted and the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/projects/configuration#02-Properties">configuration values of your local project</a> overwrite the configuration values of the cloud version. If you have renamed the project on your local machine or in the cloud before you push, the cloud project is renamed to match the name of the local project.
