    Local debugging for Python in PyCharm requires PyCharm's remote debugging functionality, which is only available in PyCharm Professional.
    After making sure you are running the Professional edition, follow these steps to start local debugging for Python in PyCharm:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Follow the <a href="https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/tutorials/local-autocomplete#02-Python-and-PyCharm">How to set up local autocomplete for Python in PyCharm</a> tutorial.</li>
    <li>Open the directory containing the <code>main.py</code> file in a new PyCharm window. It is important that you open the project directory itself, not the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in.</li>
    <li>Start debugging using the "Debug with Lean CLI" run configuration (this configuration is created when you create a new project with the CLI).

    </li>
    <li>Run the <code>lean backtest</code> command with the <code>--debug pycharm</code> option.
<div class="cli section-example-container">
<pre>$ lean backtest "My Project" --debug pycharm
20210322 18:58:23.355 TRACE:: Engine.Main(): LEAN ALGORITHMIC TRADING ENGINE v2.5.0.0 Mode: DEBUG (64bit)
20210322 18:58:23.360 TRACE:: Engine.Main(): Started 6:58 PM</pre>
</div>
    </li>
    <li>Terminate the debugger in PyCharm once LEAN has exited.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    After finishing Python debugging with PyCharm you will see a message saying "Connection to Python debugger failed".
    You can safely ignore this message.
