    Follow these steps to set up local autocomplete for C# in Visual Studio:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Make sure the .NET 5.0 Runtime is installed in the Visual Studio Installer by clicking on the "Modify" button of the installed Visual Studio version and opening the "Individual components" tab on the window that shows up.</li>
    <li>Click on "Open a project or solution" on Visual Studio's home screen and open the <code>.csproj</code> file in one of the project directories generated by the CLI. Visual Studio automatically downloads the required dependencies and indexes them to provide autocomplete.</li>
    <li>Update your project to <a href="#07-Imports">include the required imports</a>.</li>
</ol>
