    The Lean CLI is distributed as a Python package, so it requires <code>pip</code> to be installed. See <a href="https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/tutorials/installation/installing-pip">Installing pip</a> to learn how to install pip on your operating system.

    The commands which run the LEAN engine locally also depend on <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> being installed and running. See <a href="https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/tutorials/installation/installing-docker">Installing Docker</a> to learn how to install Docker on your operating system.
