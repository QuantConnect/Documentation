    If your algorithm only uses custom data, you can select the "Custom data only" data feed option in step 5 of the <a href="#01-Introduction">tutorial in the introduction</a>.
    This data feed doesn't require any brokerage credentials, but only works if your algorithm doesn't subscribe to non-custom data.
    Your algorithm crashes if it attempts to subscribe to non-custom data with this data feed in place.
