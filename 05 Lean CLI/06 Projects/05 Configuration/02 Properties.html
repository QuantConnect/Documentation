            <td>This property is a key/value object containing the project's parameters. Both the keys and the values must be strings. See <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Algorithm.Python/ParameterizedAlgorithm.py" target="_blank">ParametrizedAlgorithm.py</a> and <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Algorithm.CSharp/ParameterizedAlgorithm.cs" target="_blank">ParametrizedAlgorithm.cs</a> for examples of how to retrieve parameters in your algorithm. The parameter values are sent to your algorithm when you deploy the algorithm, so it's not possible to change the parameter values while the algorithm runs.</td>
