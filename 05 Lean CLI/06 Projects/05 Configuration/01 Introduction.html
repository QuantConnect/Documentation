<p>
    Project-specific configuration is stored in the project directory in the <span class="private-file-name">config.json</span> file.
    This file is automatically generated when you run <code>lean create-project</code> or <code>lean cloud pull</code>.
    Just like the global and Lean configuration files, the project configuration is stored as JSON but without support for comments.
    The following properties are stored in the <span class="private-file-name">config.json</span> file:

        <tr>
            <td><code>description</code></td>
            <td>This property contains the project's description, which is displayed in backtest reports. It must always be a string.</td>

        <tr>
            <td><code>parameters</code></td>
            <td>This property is a key/value object containing the project's parameters. Both the keys and the values must be strings. See <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Algorithm.Python/ParameterizedAlgorithm.py" target="_blank">ParametrizedAlgorithm.py</a> and <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Algorithm.CSharp/ParameterizedAlgorithm.cs" target="_blank">ParametrizedAlgorithm.cs</a> for examples of how to retrieve parameters in your algorithm.</td>

        <tr>
            <td><code>cloud-id</code></td>
            <td>This property is set automatically after the project has been pulled from or pushed to the cloud. It contains the id of the project's counterpart in the cloud and must not be modified or removed manually.</td>

        <tr>
            <td><code>local-id</code></td>
            <td>This property is set automatically when the CLI needs to uniquely identify the current project. It contains a unique id that is specific to the project and must not be modified or removed manually.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>algorithm-language</code></td>
            <td>This property contains the language of the project. It is automatically set when the project is created and must not be modified or removed manually.</td>

        <tr>
            <td><code>docker</code></td>
            <td>This property is a key/value object containing the docker instance's "environment" and "ports" command line run arguments. For example, to expose host port 999 to internal port 6006, write <code>"docker": { "ports": { "999": "6006"} }</code>.</td>
