    Creating new projects is an important feature of the Lean CLI.
    The CLI can automatically scaffold basic Python and C# projects, creating basic algorithm files, research notebooks, and the required editor configuration.
    Projects scaffolded by the CLI are similar to the ones created on QuantConnect, making it easy to switch between your local environment and the cloud.
