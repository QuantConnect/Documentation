<p>
    Builds local Docker images of a local version of LEAN and sets them up for local usage with the CLI.
    After running this command, all commands that run the LEAN engine or the research environment use your custom images.
    This command performs the following actions:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The <code>lean-cli/foundation:latest</code> image is built from <span class='private-file-name'>Lean/DockerfileLeanFoundation</span> (if you're using an AMD64-based system) or <span class='private-file-name'>Lean/DockerfileLeanFoundationARM</span> (if you're using an ARM64-based system).</li>
    <li>LEAN is compiled in a Docker container using the <code>lean-cli/foundation:latest</code> image.</li>
    <li>The Alpha Streams SDK is compiled in a Docker container using the <code>lean-cli/foundation:latest</code> image.</li>
    <li>The <code>lean-cli/engine:latest</code> image is built from <span class='private-file-name'>Lean/Dockerfile</span> using <code>lean-cli/foundation:latest</code> as the base image.</li>
    <li>The <code>lean-cli/research:latest</code> image is built from <span class='private-file-name'>Lean/DockerfileJupyter</span> using <code>lean-cli/engine:latest</code> as the base image.</li>
    <li>The default engine image is set to <code>lean-cli/engine:latest</code>.</li>
    <li>The default research image is set to <code>lean-cli/research:latest</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    When the foundation Dockerfile is the same as the one used for the official foundation image, step 1 is skipped and <code>quantconnect/lean:foundation</code> is used instead of <code>lean-cli/foundation:latest</code>.
