<p>
    Runs a local Jupyter Lab environment in a Docker container using the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/quantconnect/research" target="_blank">quantconnect/research</a> Docker image.
    The project directory is mounted in the Docker container and the Jupyter Lab instance is exposed on a local port.
    After the Jupyter Lab instance has started the browser is automatically opened.
</p>

<p>
    By default, Jupyter Lab is exposed on port 8888.
    To use a custom port you can use the <code>--port</code> option, which is required to run two Jupyter Lab instances side-by-side.
</p>

<p>
    You can use the <code>--data-provider</code> option to change where data is retrieved from.
    This option updates the Lean configuration file, so you don't need to use this option multiple times for the same data provider if you are not switching between them.
    Additionally, you can also use the <code>--download-data</code> flag as an alias for <code>--data-provider QuantConnect</code>, and the <code>--data-purchase-limit</code> option to set the maximum amount of QCC to spend during the research session when using QuantConnect as data provider.
    The <code>--data-purchase-limit</code> option is not persistent.
</p>

<p>
    If you have previously logged in using <code>lean login</code> the CLI automatically makes your credentials available in the Jupyter Lab instance.
    If this happens the <code>api</code> variable is automatically assigned an instance of <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Api/Api.cs" target="_blank">Api</a> in your research notebooks which you can use to make authenticated requests to the QuantConnect API.
</p>

<p>
    By default, the official LEAN research image is used.
    You can override this using the <code>--image &lt;value&gt;</code> option.
    Alternatively, you can set the default research image using <code>lean config set research-image &lt;value&gt;</code>.
    The image is pulled before starting the research environment if it doesn't exist locally yet or if you pass the <code>--update</code> flag.
