<p>
    Pushes local projects to QuantConnect while preserving the directory structure of your local projects.
    The project's files, its description, and its parameters are pushed to the cloud.
    By default, all local projects are pushed, unless a <code>--project</code> is specified, in which case a single project is pushed.
</p>

<p>
    Before pushing a local project, the CLI checks if the cloud project with the same path already exists.
    If it does and the cloud project is not linked to the local project (because of an earlier <code>lean cloud pull</code> or <code>lean cloud push</code>) the CLI skips pushing the cloud project and logs a descriptive warning message.
    If the cloud project does not exist yet, the CLI creates it for you and pushes the contents of the local project to the newly created cloud project.
</p>

<p>
    Files in the cloud which don't exist locally are not deleted by this command.
