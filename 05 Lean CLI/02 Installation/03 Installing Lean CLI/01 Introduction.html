<p>
    The Lean CLI is distributed as a Python package, so it requires <code>pip</code> to be installed. To learn how to install <code>pip</code> on your operating system, see <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/installation/installing-pip">Installing pip</a>.

    The commands which run the LEAN engine locally also depend on <a href='https://www.docker.com/' target='_blank'>Docker</a> being installed and running.
