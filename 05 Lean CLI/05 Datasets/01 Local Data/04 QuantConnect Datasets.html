    The recommended way to source LEAN-compatible data for local usage is by purchasing and downloading it from <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets" target="_blank">QuantConnect Datasets</a>.
    This data is curated and maintained by QuantConnect and is easy to download <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/datasets/downloading-quantconnect-data#02-Using-the-CLI">with the CLI</a> or by <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/datasets/downloading-quantconnect-data#03-Using-Lean">using the ApiDataProvider in LEAN</a>. Before the CLI and ApiDataProvider download new files, they check if your local machine already stores the files.<br></p>
