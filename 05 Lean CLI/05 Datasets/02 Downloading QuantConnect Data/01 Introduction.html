<p>
    Running the LEAN engine locally with the CLI requires you to have your own local data.
    The recommended way to source local data is by purchasing and downloading it from QuantConnect Datasets.
    This way you can use the same data that is available to your algorithm when you run it in the cloud.
    You can download this data manually using the CLI or on-demand using LEAN.
    Before the CLI or LEAN download new files, they checks if your local machine already stores the files. 
    The available data and pricing information can be found in the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets">Dataset Market</a>.
