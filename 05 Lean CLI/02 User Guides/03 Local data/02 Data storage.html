<p>
    When you run <code>lean init</code> in an empty directory, the CLI downloads the latest <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/tree/master/Data">data directory from the LEAN repository</a>.
    This directory contains a standard directory structure from which the LEAN engine reads.
    Because LEAN strives to use an open, human-readable format all data is stored in flat files (formatted as CSV or JSON), and compression is done using zip.
    Once downloaded, the data directory tree looks like this:
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre>data
├── alternative/
├── cfd/
├── crypto/
├── equity/
├── forex/
├── future/
├── futureoption/
├── index/
├── indexoption/
├── market-hours/
├── option/
├── symbol-properties/
└── readme.md</pre>
</div>

<p>
    By default, the data directory contains a small amount of sample data for all asset types to demonstrate how data files must be formatted.
    Additionally, the data directory itself and most of its subdirectories contain <code>readme.md</code> files containing more documentation on the format of the data files of each asset type.
