<p>
    A locally-focused workflow (local development, local execution) with the CLI might look like this:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open a terminal in the directory you ran <code>lean init</code> in.</li>
    <li>Run <code>lean create-project "Project Name"</code> to create a new project with some basic code to get you started.</li>
    <li>Work on your strategy in <code>./Project Name</code>.</li>
    <li>Run <code>lean research "Project Name"</code> to start a Jupyter Lab session to perform research in.</li>
    <li>Run <code>lean backtest "Project Name"</code> to run a backtest whenever there's something to test. This command runs your strategy in a Docker container containing the same packages as the ones used on QuantConnect.com, but with your own data.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    With this workflow, you are not limited to the computing power that's available in QuantConnect's infrastructure, because everything runs locally.
    On the other hand, this also means you must have all your required data available locally.
    When using this workflow you might be interested in the <a href="https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/tutorials/local-data/downloading-from-quantconnect">Local data</a> tutorials, which explain how to download some of QuantConnect's data for local usage.
