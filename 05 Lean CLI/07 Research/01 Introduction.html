    Starting local Jupyter Lab environments is a powerful feature of the Lean CLI.
    Jupyter Lab environments allow you to work on research notebooks locally.
    These environments contain the same features as <a href="/docs/v2/research-environment">QuantConnect's research environment</a> but run locally with your own data.
