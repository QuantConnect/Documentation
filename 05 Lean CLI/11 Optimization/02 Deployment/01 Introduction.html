    The Lean CLI supports optimizing a project's parameters on your local machine or in the cloud using LEAN's powerful optimization strategies.
    Optimization is helpful when you want to find the best combination of parameters to minimize or maximize a certain statistic, like the algorithm's <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/key-concepts/glossary#24-Sharpe-ratio'>Sharpe ratio</a> or <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/key-concepts/glossary#11-drawdown'>drawdown</a>. If your run optimizations in the cloud, you don't need your own powerful machine or data library.
