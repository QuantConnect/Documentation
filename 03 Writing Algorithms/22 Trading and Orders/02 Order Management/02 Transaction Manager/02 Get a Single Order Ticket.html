<p>If you didn't save a reference to the order ticket when you created an order, you can call the <code>GetOrderTicket</code> method to get it. You need to pass the order ID to the method. If you don't have the order ID, you can use the <code>LastOrderId</code> property to get the order ID of the most recent order.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">var orderId = Transactions.LastOrderId;
var ticket = Transactions.GetOrderTicket(orderId);</pre>
<pre class="python">order_id = self.transactions.last_order_id
ticket = self.transactions.get_order_ticket(order_id)</pre>
</div>
