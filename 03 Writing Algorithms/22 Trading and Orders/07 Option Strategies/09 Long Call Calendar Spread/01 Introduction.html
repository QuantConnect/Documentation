<p><span class="new-term">Long call calendar spread</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">call horizontal spread</span>, is a combination of a longer-term (far-leg/front-month) call and a shorter-term (near-leg/back-month) call, where all calls have the same underlying stock and the same strike price.
 The long call calendar spread consists of buying a longer-term call and selling a shorter-term call. This strategy profits from a decrease in the underlying price. It also profits from the time decay value because the theta $\theta$ (the Option price decay by 1 day closer to maturity) of the shorter-term call is larger than longer-term call.</p>
