<div class="highlight">Warning: There is currently no <code>OptionStrategies</code> method for Iron Butterfly orders, so this tutorial manually orders the individual legs in the strategy. If you manually place multi-leg orders one at a time while there is no liquidity at a strike price, you can get stuck in an unhedged position.</div>

<p>
The <span class="new-term">Iron Butterfly</span> is an option strategy which involves four Option contracts. All the contracts have the same underlying stock and expiration, but the order of strike prices for the four contracts is $A&gt;B&gt;C$. The following table describes the strike price of each contract:</p>
<table class="table qc-table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Position</th>
<th>Strike</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1 OTM call</td>
<td> $A$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 ATM call</td>
<td> $B$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 ATM put</td>
<td> $B$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 OTM put</td>
<td> $C=B-(A-B)$</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The iron butterfly can be long or short.</p>

<h4>Long Iron Butterfly</h4>
<p>The long iron butterfly consists of selling an OTM call, selling an OTM put, buying an ATM call, and buying an ATM put. This strategy profits from a decrease in price movement (implied volatility).</p>


<h4>Short Call Butterfly</h4>
<p>The short call butterfly consists of buying an OTM call, buying an OTM put, selling an ATM call, and selling an ATM put. This strategy profits from an increase in price movement (implied volatility) and from time decay value since ATM options decay sharper.</p>
