<p>The following chart shows the payoff at expiration:</p>

<p>The maximum profit is $C^{K}_0$, which occurs when the underlying price is at or below the strike price of the call at expiration.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is unlimited because there is no limit to how high the underlying asset's price can rise.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is risk of early assignment on the sold contract.</p>
