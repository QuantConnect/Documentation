<p>The following chart shows the payoff at expiration:</p>
<img class="docs-image" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/long-call-butterfly.png" alt="Strategy payoff decomposition and analysis of long call butterfly">
<p>The maximum profit is $K^{ATM} - K^{ITM} + 2\times C^{ATM}_0 - C^{ITM}_0 - C^{OTM}_0$. It occurs when the underlying price is the same price at expiration as it was when opening the position and the payouts of the bull and bear call spreads are at their maximum.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is the net debit paid: $2\times C^{ATM}_0 - C^{ITM}_0 - C^{OTM}_0$. It occurs when the underlying price is less than ITM strike or greater than OTM strike at expiration.</p>
<p>If the Option is an American Option, there is a risk of early assignment on the sold contracts.</p>
