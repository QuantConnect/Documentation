<p><span class="new-term">Put calendar spread</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">put horizontal spread</span>, is a combination of a longer-term (far-leg/front-month) put and a shorter-term (near-leg/back-month) put, where both puts have the same underlying stock and the same strike price.
 The short put calendar spread consists of selling a longer-term put and buying a shorter-term put. This strategy profits from an increase in price movement.</p>
