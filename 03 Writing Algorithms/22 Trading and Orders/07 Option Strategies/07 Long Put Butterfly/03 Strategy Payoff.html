<p>The following chart shows the payoff at expiration:</p>
<img class="docs-image" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/long-put-butterfly.png" alt="Strategy payoff decomposition and analysis of long put butterfly">
<p>The maximum profit is $K^{ATM} - K^{OTM} + 2\times P^{ATM}_0 - P^{ITM}_0 - P^{OTM}_0$. It occurs when the underlying price is the same at expiration as it was when you open the trade. In this case, the payout of the combined bull put and bear put spreads are at their maximum.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is the net debit paid, $2\times P^{ATM}_0 - P^{ITM}_0 - P^{OTM}_0$. It occurs when the underlying price is below the ITM strike price or above the OTM strike price at expiration.</p>

<p>If the Option is American Option, there is risk of early assignment on the sold contracts.</p>
