<p>The long put calendar spread is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is taken at the shorter-term expiration. The payoff is</p>

<p>The maximum profit is undetermined because it depends on the underlying volatility.&nbsp; It occurs when $S_T = S_0$ and the spread of the puts are at their maximum.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is the net debit paid, $P^{\textrm{short-term}}_0 - P^{\textrm{long-term}}_0$. It occurs when the underlying price moves very deep ITM or OTM so the values of both puts are close to zero.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is risk of early assignment on the sold contract. Naked long puts pose risk of losing all the debit paid if you don't close the position with short put together and the price drops below its strike.</p>
