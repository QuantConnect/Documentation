<p><span class="new-term">Short Put butterfly</span> is the combination of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bull-put-spread">bull put spread</a> and a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bear-put-spread">bear put spread</a>. In this strategy, all the puts have the same underlying stock, the same expiration date, and the strike price distance of ITM-ATM and OTM-ATM put pairs are the same.
 The short put butterfly strategy consists of selling an ITM put, selling an OTM put, and buying 2 ATM puts. This strategy profits from a drastic change in underlying price.</p>
