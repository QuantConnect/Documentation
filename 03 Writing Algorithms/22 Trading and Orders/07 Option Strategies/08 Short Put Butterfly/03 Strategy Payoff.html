<p>The following chart shows the payoff at expiration:</p>
<img class="docs-image" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/short-put-butterfly.png" alt="Strategy payoff decomposition and analysis of short put butterfly">

<p>The maximum profit is the net credit received, $P^{ITM}_0 + P^{OTM}_0 - 2\times P^{ATM}_0$. It occurs when the underlying price is below the ITM strike or above the OTM strike at expiration.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is $K^{ATM} - K^{OTM} - 2\times P^{ATM}_0 + P^{ITM}_0 + P^{OTM}_0$. It occurs when the underlying price at expiration is at the same price as when you opened the trade.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is risk of early assignment on the sold contracts.<br></p>
