<p><span class="new-term">Call calendar spread</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">call horizontal spread</span>, is a combination of a longer-term (far-leg/front-month) call and a shorter-term (near-leg/back-month) call, where all calls have the same underlying stock and the same strike price.
 The short call calendar spread consists of selling a longer-term call and buying a shorter-term call. The strategy profits from from an increase in the underlying price.</p>
