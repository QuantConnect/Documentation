<p>The following chart shows the payoff at expiration:</p>
<img class="docs-image" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/short-call-calendar-spread.png" alt="Strategy payoff decomposition and analysis of short call calendar spread">

<p>The maximum profit is the net credit received, $C^{\textrm{long-term}}_0 - C^{\textrm{short-term}}_0$. It occurs when the underlying price moves very deep ITM or OTM so the values of both calls are close to zero.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is undetermined because it depends on the underlying volatility. It occurs when $S_T = S_0$ and the spread of the 2 calls are at their maximum.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is risk of early assignment on the sold contract. If you don't close the call positions together, the naked short call will have unlimited drawdown risk after the long call expires.</p>
