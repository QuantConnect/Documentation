<table class="table qc-table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Position</th>
<th>Strike</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1 far-OTM call</td>
<td> $A$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 near-OTM call</td>
<td> $B, where B &gt; underlying\ price$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 near-OTM put</td>
<td> $C, where C &lt; underlying\ price$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 far-OTM put</td>
<td> $D, where C-D = A-B$</td>

<p>The iron condor can be long or short.</p>
<h4>Long Iron Condor</h4>
<p>The long iron condor consists of selling a far OTM call, selling a far OTM put, buying a near OTM call, and buying a near OTM put. This strategy profits from a increase in price movement (implied volatility).</p>

<h4>Short Iron Condor</h4>
<p>The short iron condor consists of buying a far OTM call, buying a far OTM put, selling a near ATM call, and selling a near ATM put. This strategy profits from an decrease in price movement (implied volatility) and time decay since ATM options decay sharper.</p>
