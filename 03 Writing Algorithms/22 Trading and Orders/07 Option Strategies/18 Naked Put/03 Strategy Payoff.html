<p>The following chart shows the payoff at expiration:</p>
<img class="docs-image" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/naked-put.png" alt="Strategy payoff decomposition and analysis of naked put">
<p>The maximum profit is $P^{K}_0$, which occurs when the underlying price is at or above the strike price of the put at expiration.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is $K - P^{K}_0$, which ocurrs when the underlying price drops to zero.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is risk of early assignment on the sold contract.</p>
