<p>The following chart shows the payoff at expiration:</p>
<img class="docs-image" src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/short-call-butterfly.png" alt="Strategy payoff decomposition and analysis of short call butterfly">

<p>The maximum profit is the net credit received: $C^{ITM}_0 + C^{OTM}_0 - 2\times C^{ATM}_0$. It occurs when the underlying price is less than ITM strike or greater than OTM strike at expiration.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is $K^{ATM} - K^{ITM} + C^{ITM}_0 + C^{OTM}_0 - 2\times C^{ATM}_0$. It occurs when the underlying price is at the same level as when you opened the trade.</p>
<p>If the Option is an American Option, there is a risk of early assignment on the sold contracts.<br></p>
