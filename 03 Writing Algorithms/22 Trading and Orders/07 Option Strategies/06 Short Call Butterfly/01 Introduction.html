<p>The <span class="new-term">short call butterfly</span> strategy is the combination of a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bull-call-spread">bull call spread</a> and a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/bear-call-spread">bear call spread</a>. In the call butterfly, all of the calls should have the same underlying Equity, the same expiration date, and the same strike price distance between the ITM-ATM and OTM-ATM call pairs.
 The short call butterfly consists of a short ITM call, a short OTM call, and 2 long ATM calls. This strategy profits from high volatility in the underlying Equity price.</p>
