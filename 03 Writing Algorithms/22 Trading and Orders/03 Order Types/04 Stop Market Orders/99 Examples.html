 The following backtest verifies the
 <code class="csharp">

 <code class="python">
  stop_market_order
 </code>
 behavior. On even days, the algorithm buys SPY at the current market price and sells when the price drops 1%. On odd days, the algorithm shorts SPY and buys when the price rises 1%. The following table shows the first four trades in the backtest:

 On July 1, 2021, the algorithm shorts SPY at $429.10 and then buys it back at $433.44 when the stop price is $433.43. The stop price is 1% above the market price. Note that $429.10 is not the market price when the algorithm places the first two orders. $429.10 is the fill price at the bid, but it's not far from the market price because 429.1 * 1.01 = 433.39. The fill price of the stop market order is $433.44, which, as expected, is higher than $433.43. The fill model assumes the worst-case scenario between the market price and the stop price. In this case, the worst-case scenario is the maximum of the market price and stop price.

<p>
 On July 2, 2021, the algorithm buys SPY at $433.44 and sells it at $429 when the stop price is $429.10. The stop price is 1% below the market price. Note that $433.44 is not the market price when the algorithm places the second two orders. $433.44 is the fill price at the ask, but it's not far off from the market price because 433.44 * 0.99 = 429.11. The fill price of the stop market order is $429, which, as expected, is lower than $429.10. The fill model assumes the worst-case scenario between the market price and the stop price. In this case, the worst-case scenario is the minimum of the market price and stop price.
