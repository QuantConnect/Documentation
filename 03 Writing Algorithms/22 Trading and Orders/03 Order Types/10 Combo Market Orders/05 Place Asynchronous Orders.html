<p>When you trade a large portfolio of assets, you may want to send orders in batches and not wait for the response of each one. To send asynchronous orders, set the <code>asynchronous</code> argument to true.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">ComboMarketOrder(legs, quantity, true);</pre>
<pre class="python">self.ComboMarketOrder(legs, quantity, True)</pre>
</div>
