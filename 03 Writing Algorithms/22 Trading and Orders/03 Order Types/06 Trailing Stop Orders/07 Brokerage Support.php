<p>If your brokerage doesn't support them, you can implement a workaround with <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/stop-market-orders'>stop market orders</a>. For an example, see the <a href="/learning/task/87/introduction-video">Buy and Hold with a Trailing Stop</a> Bootcamp lesson.</p>
