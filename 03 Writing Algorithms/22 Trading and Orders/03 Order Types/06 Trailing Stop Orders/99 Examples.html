<p>The following backtest verifies the <code class="csharp">TrailingStopOrder</code><code class="python">trailing_stop_order</code> behavior. On even days, the algorithm buys SPY at the current market price and sells when the price drops 1%. On odd days, the algorithm shorts SPY and buys when the price rises 1%. The following table shows the first four trades in the backtest:</p>

<p>On July 1, 2021, the algorithm shorts SPY at $429.10 and then buys it back at $433.16 when the stop price is $433.16. The stop price is 0.95% above the market price. Note that $429.10 is not the market price when the algorithm places the first two orders. The market price is $429.14, and the initial stop price is 429.14 * 1.01 = 433.4314. The market price drops to $428.86 at 9:40, and the stop price is set to 428.86 * 1.01 = 433.1486. The fill price of the stop market order is $433.16, which, as expected, is higher than $433.15. The fill model assumes the worst-case scenario between the market price and the stop price. In this case, the worst-case scenario is the maximum of the market price and stop price.</p>

<p>On July 2, 2021, the algorithm buys SPY at $433.16 and then sells it at $429 when the stop price is $429.00. The stop price is 0.96% below the market price. Note that $433.16 is not the market price when the algorithm places the second two orders. The market price is $433.155, and the initial stop price is 433.155 * 0.99 = 428.82345. The market prices increased to $434.76 on July 7 at 3:35 PM, and the stop price is set to 434.76 * 0.99 = 430.4124. The fill price of the stop market order is $429, which, as expected, is lower than $430.41. The fill model assumes the worst-case scenario between the market price and the stop price. In this case, the worst-case scenario is the minimum of the market price and stop price in a gap down opening.</p>
