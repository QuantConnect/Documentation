<p>MOO orders fill at the opening auction. If the auction is heavily skewed to one side of the market, your MOO order may not fill. To monitor the fills of your order, save a reference to the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-management/order-tickets">order ticket</a>.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Buy 10 shares of SPY at the market open
var ticket = MarketOnOpenOrder("SPY", 10);
Debug($"Quantity filled: {ticket.QuantityFilled}; Fill price: {ticket.AverageFillPrice}");</pre>
<pre class="python"># Buy 10 shares of SPY at the market open
ticket = self.market_on_open_order("SPY", 10)
self.debug(f"Quantity filled: {ticket.quantity_filled}; Fill price: {ticket.average_fill_price}")</pre>
</div>

If the asset price moves before the market open to where you can't afford the quantity of the order, the brokerage rejects your order. To increase the probability of a successful trade, leave a sufficient <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/position-sizing#05-Buying-Power-Buffer">buying power buffer</a> to handle daily price gaps.</p>
