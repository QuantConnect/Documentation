<p>MOC orders fill at the closing auction. If the auction is heavily skewed to one side of the market, your MOC order may not fill. To monitor the fills of your order, save a reference to the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-management/order-tickets">order ticket</a>.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Buy 10 shares of SPY at the market close
var ticket = MarketOnCloseOrder("SPY", 10);
Debug($"Quantity filled: {ticket.QuantityFilled}; Fill price: {ticket.AverageFillPrice}");</pre>
<pre class="python"># Buy 10 shares of SPY at the market close
ticket = self.market_on_close_order("SPY", 10)
self.debug(f"Quantity filled: {ticket.quantity_filled}; Fill price: {ticket.average_fill_price}")</pre>
</div>

<p>You won't know the fill price of the order until after the market closes. If the asset price moves before the market close to where you can't afford the quantity of the order, the brokerage rejects your order. To increase the probability of a successful trade, leave a sufficient <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/position-sizing#05-Buying-Power-Buffer">buying power buffer</a> to handle the price movements before the close.</p>
