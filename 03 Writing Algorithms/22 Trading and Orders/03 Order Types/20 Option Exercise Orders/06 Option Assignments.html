<p>If you sell an Option in a backtest, LEAN can simulate an Option exercise order on behalf of the buyer. Every 2 hours, the <code>BasicOptionAssignmentSimulation</code> scans your portfolio. It considers exercising American-style Options if they are within 4 days of their expiration and it considers exercising European-style Options on their day of expiration. If you have sold an Option that's 5% in-the-money and the Option exercise order is profitable after the cost of fees, LEAN exercises the Option. To view the source code of the Option assignment logic, see the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Brokerages/Backtesting/BasicOptionAssignmentSimulation.cs">BasicOptionAssignmentSimulation</a> in the LEAN GitHub repository.</p>
