<p>You can submit market on open (MOO) orders at any time for Equity, Equity Options, and Index Options.</p>
<p>Markets that operate 24/7 don't support MOO orders. The Forex market doesn't operate during the weekend. However, MOO orders are invalid if you place them after this market closes for the weekend.</p>

<p>MOO orders don't support the <code>GoodTilDate</code> <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-properties#03-Time-In-Force'>time in force</a>. If you submit a MOO order with the <code>GoodTilDate</code> time in force, LEAN automatically adjusts the time in force to be <code>GoodTilCanceled</code>.</p>
