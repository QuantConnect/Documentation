<p>The <code>SetHoldings</code> method calculates the number of asset units to purchase based on the portfolio weight you provide and then submits market orders. This method provides a quick way to set up a portfolio with a set of weights for assets. If you already have holdings, you may want to liquidate the existing holdings first to free up buying power.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Allocate 50% of portfolio value to IBM
SetHoldings("IBM", 0.5);

// Allocate 50% of portfolio value to IBM, but liquidate other holdings first
SetHoldings("IBM", 0.5, true);

// Provide a tag and order properties to the SetHoldings method
SetHoldings(symbol, weight, liquidateExistingHoldings, tag, orderProperties);
</pre>
<pre class="python"> # Allocate 50% of buying power to IBM
self.set_holdings("IBM", 0.5)

# Allocate 50% of portfolio value to IBM, but liquidate other holdings first
self.set_holdings("IBM", 0.5, True)

# Provide a tag and order properties to the SetHoldings method
self.set_holdings(symbol, weight, liquidate_existing_holdings, tag, order_properties)</pre>
</div>

<p>If the percentage you provide translates to an order quantity of 0, the <code>SetHoldings</code> method doesn’t place an order and doesn’t log anything.</p>
