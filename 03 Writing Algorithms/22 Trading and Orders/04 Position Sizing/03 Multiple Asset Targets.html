<p>When you trade a weighted basket of assets, sometimes you must intelligently scale down existing positions before increasing allocations to other assets. If you call the <code>SetHoldings</code> method with a list of <code>PortfolioTarget</code> objects, LEAN sorts the orders based on your position delta and then places the orders that reduce your position size in an asset before it places orders that increase your position size in an asset. When you call the <code>SetHoldings</code> method with a list of <code>PortfolioTarget</code> objects, the decimal you pass to the <code>PortfolioTarget</code> constructor represents the portfolio weight. Don't use the <code>PortfolioTarget.Percent</code> method.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Purchase a portfolio of targets, processing orders intelligently.
var targets = new List&lt;PortfolioTarget&gt;() {
      new PortfolioTarget("SPY", 0.8m),
      new PortfolioTarget("IBM", 0.2m)
};
SetHoldings(targets);
</pre>
<pre class="python"># Purchase a portfolio of targets, processing orders intelligently.
self.SetHoldings([PortfolioTarget("SPY", 0.8), PortfolioTarget("IBM", 0.2)])
</pre>
</div>
