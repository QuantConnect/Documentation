<p>QuantConnect supports <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/brokerages">several brokerages</a>. Each brokerage trades different asset classes and support different order types. LEAN doesn't allow placing orders that don't meet these requirements. For example, your algorithm cannot place a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/trailing-stop-orders#07-Brokerage-Support">trailing stop</a> order for most brokerages.

<p>By default, LEAN uses the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages/supported-models/quantconnect-paper-trading">default brokerage model</a> that suports all order types and all asset classes. To avoid issues with unsupported order types and asset classes when live trading, <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/initialization#05-Set-Brokerage-and-Cash-Model'>set the brokerage model</a> to a brokerage that supports them.</p>

<div class='section-example-container'>
    <pre class='csharp'>SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.TradeStation);</pre>
    <pre class='python'>self.set_brokerage_model(BrokerageName.TRADE_STATION)</pre>
</div>

<p>QuantConnect ensures your algorithm is always online, checking its status every few seconds. While a strategy is live it is also always connected to your brokerage, ensuring there is a route to quickly place trades when needed.</p>
