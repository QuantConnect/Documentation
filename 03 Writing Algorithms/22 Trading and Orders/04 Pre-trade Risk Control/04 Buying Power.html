<p>When you place an order, LEAN uses the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/buying-power">buying power model</a> to determine whether the order should be submitted so you avoid placing orders that would be rejected by the brokerage. Buying power calculations can be very complex and depend on many factors, including the brokerage or even the time of day. The main factors include your current portfolio holdings, available cash, and margin requirements.</p>

<p>The buying power calculations are restricted to portfolio your algorithm is connected to. QuantConnect doesn't support multi-account risk controls.</p>
