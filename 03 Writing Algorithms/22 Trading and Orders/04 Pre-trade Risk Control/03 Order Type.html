<p>QuantConnect supports <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types">several order types</a>. To see the requirements of each order, see the <span class='page-section-name'>Requirements</span> section of <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/key-concepts#03-Order-Types'>the documentation for the order types</a>. LEAN doesn't allow placing orders that don't meet these requirements. For example, your algorithm cannot place a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/market-on-close-orders#08-Requirements">market-on-close</a> order from cryto-currencies because they operate 24/7.</p>
