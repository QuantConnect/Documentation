<p>In live trading, we send your orders to the API of your brokerage and wait for their response to update the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-events#03-Order-States'>status of the order ticket</a> from <code class="csharp">New</code><code class="python">NEW</code> to <code class="csharp">Submitted</code><code class="python">SUBMITTED</code>, <code class="csharp">Canceled</code><code class="python">CANCELED</code>, or <code class="csharp">Invalid</code><code class="python">INVALID</code>. When you place multiple orders, waiting for responses from the brokerage delays the last orders of the batch. To avoid this delay, you can place orders asynchronously. When you place an order asynchronously, LEAN sends the order to your brokerage and immediately continues executing your algorithm without waiting for a response. When the response from the brokerage arrives, LEAN updates the status of the order ticket accordingly, and your algorithm  receives an <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-events'>order event</a>.</p>
