A dataless scheduled universe let's you select a set of assets on a specific schedule.
You can control which days the other types of universe run by adjusting the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/universes/settings#10-Schedule'>Schedule universe setting</a>.
However, the <code class="csharp">Schedule</code><code class="python">schedule</code> universe setting doesn't accept a <code>TimeRule</code> argument, so you can't control the time of the day they run.
In contrast, a dataless scheduled universe accepts a <code>TimeRule</code> argument, but its selection function only receives the algorithm time.
