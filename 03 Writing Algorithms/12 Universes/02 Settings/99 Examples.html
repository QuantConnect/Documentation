<p>The following examples demonstrate some common practices for universe settings.</p>

<h4>Example 1: Weekly-Updating Liquid Universe</h4>
<p>The following algorithm demonstrates daily EMA cross, trading on the top 10 most liquid stocks. The universe is set to be updated weekly. Various universe settings have been set to simulate the brokerage environment best and for trading needs.</p>
