<p>The universe manager tracks all the universes in your algorithm. If you add multiple universe, you can access the constituents of each individual universe. To access the constituents of a universe in a multi-universe algorithm, save references to each universe when you add them.</p>

 <div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">private Universe _universe;

// In Initialize
UniverseSettings.Asynchronous = true;
_universe = AddUniverse(MyFundamentalFilterFunction);

// In OnData
var universeMembers = UniverseManager[_universe.Configuration.Symbol].Members;
foreach (var kvp in universeMembers)
{
    var symbol = kvp.Key;
    var security = kvp.Value;
}</pre>
<pre class="python"># In Initialize
self.UniverseSettings.Asynchronous = True
self.universe = self.AddUniverse(self.MyFundamentalFilterFunction)

# In OnData
universe_members = self.UniverseManager[self.universe.Configuration.Symbol].Members
for kvp in universe_members:
    symbol = kvp.Key
    security = kvp.Value</pre>
</div>

<p>
When you remove an asset from a universe, LEAN usually removes the security from the <code>Members</code> collection and removes the security subscription. 
However, it won't remove the security in any of the following situations: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>You own the security.</li>
    <li>You have an open order for the security.</li>
    <li>The security wasn't in the universe long enough to meet the <code>MinimumTimeInUniverse</code> setting.</li>
</ul>

<p>To get only the assets that are currently in the universe, see <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/universes/key-concepts#11-Selected-Securities'>Selected Securities</a>.</p>
