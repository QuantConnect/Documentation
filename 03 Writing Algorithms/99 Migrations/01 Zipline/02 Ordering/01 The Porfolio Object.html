  Quantopian's <code>Portfolio</code> class provides read-only access to the current portfolio state. The state 
  includes starting cash, current cash, portfolio value, and positions. The <code>Portfolio</code> object is accessed
  through the <code>context</code> object, as seen below.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">  
context.portfolio.starting_cash     # Amount of cash in the portfolio at the start of the backtest
                 .cash              # Amount of cash currently held in portfolio
                 .portfolio_value   # Current liquidation value of the portfolio's holdings
                 .positions         # Dict-like object for currently-held positions
</pre>
</div>

<p>
  All of this information, and more, is attainable on QuantConnect by using our <code>Portfolio</code> object. Listed 
  below is an example of doing so. Although there isn't a property for starting cash, this value can be saved during 
  <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/migrations/zipline/initialization">Initialization</a> to be referenced
  later.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
self.portfolio.cash                  # Sum of all currencies in account (only settled cash)
              .total_portfolio_value   # Portfolio equity
              .keys                  # Collection of Symbol objects in the portfolio
              .values                # Collection of SecurityHolding objects in the portfolio
</pre>
</div>

<p>
  On Quantopian, by iterating through the <code>positions</code> dictionary, we can access information about 
  currently-held positions. This includes the number of shares held, the last traded price &amp; date of the asset, and the 
  position's cost basis. 
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">  
for sid, position in context.portfolio.positions.iteritems():
    position.amount            # Number of shares in the position 
            .cost_basis        # Volume weighted average price paid per share
            .last_sale_price   # Price at last sale of the asset on the exchange 
            .last_sale_date    # Date of last sale of the asset on the exchange
</pre>
</div>


<p>
  Since the <code>Portfolio</code> on QuantConnect is a <code>Dictionary&lt;Symbol, SecurityHolding&gt;</code>, we can 
  get information on current positions by indexing the <code>Portfolio</code> object with a <code>Symbol</code> or 
  ticker. The <code>SecurityHolding</code> object that is returned contains information related to a single security in 
  the portfolio. For instance, we have
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
self.portfolio[symbol].quantity                 # Number of shares held
                      .average_price             # Average price of shares held (aka cost basis)
                      .price                    # Last traded price of the security
</pre>
</div>
