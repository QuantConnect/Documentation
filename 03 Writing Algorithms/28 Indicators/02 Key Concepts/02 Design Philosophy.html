<p>Technical indicators take in a stream of data points, <code>Bar</code> objects, or <code>TradeBar</code> objects and produce a continuous value. Candlestick patterns take in a stream of <code>Bar</code> or <code>TradeBar</code> objects and produce a 
value that's either 0, 1, or -1 to signify the presence of the pattern.</p>

<p>You can configure technical indicators and candlestick patterns to receive manual or automatic updates. With manual indicators, you update the indicator with whatever data you want and whenever you want. With automatic indicators, the algorithm automatically uses the security data to update the indicator value.</p>

<p>LEAN's technical indicators are typically implemented "on-line". This means as data pipes through, it updates the internal state of the indicator. Other platforms perform indicator math on an array of values in bulk, making it easy to constantly update the most recent entry. The downside to the bulk approach is it can be very inefficient for various indicators.</p>
