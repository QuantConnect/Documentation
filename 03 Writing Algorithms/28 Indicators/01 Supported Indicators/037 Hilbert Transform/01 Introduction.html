<p>This indicator computes the Hilbert Transform Indicator by John Ehlers. By using present and prior price differences, and some feedback, price values are split into their complex number components of real (inPhase) and imaginary (quadrature) parts. <remark><sup><a href="https://www.technicalanalysis.org.uk/moving-averages/Ehle.pdf</remark>">source</a></sup></p>
