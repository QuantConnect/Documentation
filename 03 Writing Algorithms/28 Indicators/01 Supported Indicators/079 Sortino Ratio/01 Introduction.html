<p>Calculation of the Sortino Ratio, a modification of the <see cref="T:QuantConnect.Indicators.SharpeRatio" />. Reference: https://www.cmegroup.com/education/files/rr-sortino-a-sharper-ratio.pdf Formula: S(x) = (R - T) / TDD Where: S(x) - Sortino ratio of x R - the average period return T - the target or required rate of return for the investment strategy under consideration. In Sortino’s early work, T was originally known as the minimum acceptable return, or MAR. In his more recent work, MAR is now referred to as the Desired Target Return. TDD - the target downside deviation. <see cref="T:QuantConnect.Indicators.TargetDownsideDeviation" /></p>
