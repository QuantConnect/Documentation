<p>In the DeMarker strategy, for some period of size N, set: <para> DeMax = High - Previous High, and DeMin = Previous Low - Low </para> where, in the prior, if either term is less than zero (DeMax or DeMin), set it to zero. We can now define the indicator itself, DEM, as: <para> DEM = MA(DeMax)/(MA(DeMax)+MA(DeMin)) </para> where MA denotes a Moving Average of period N. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/demarkerindicator.asp</p>
