<p>This indicator computes the True Strength Index (TSI). The True Strength Index is calculated as explained here: https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=technical_indicators:True_strength_index Briefly, the calculation has three steps: 1. Smooth the momentum and the absolute momentum by getting an EMA of them (typically of period 25) 2. Double smooth the momentum and the absolute momentum by getting an EMA of their EMA (typically of period 13) 3. The TSI formula itself: divide the double-smoothed momentum over the double-smoothed absolute momentum and multiply by 100 The signal is typically a 7-to-12-EMA of the TSI.</p>
