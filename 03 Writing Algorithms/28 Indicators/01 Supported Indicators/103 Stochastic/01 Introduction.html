<p>This indicator computes the Slow Stochastics %K and %D. The Fast Stochastic %K is is computed by (Current Close Price - Lowest Price of given Period) / (Highest Price of given Period - Lowest Price of given Period) multiplied by 100. Once the Fast Stochastic %K is calculated the Slow Stochastic %K is calculated by the average/smoothed price of of the Fast %K with the given period. The Slow Stochastic %D is then derived from the Slow Stochastic %K with the given period.</p>
