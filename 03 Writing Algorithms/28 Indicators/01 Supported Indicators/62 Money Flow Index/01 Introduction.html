<p>The Money Flow Index (MFI) is an oscillator that uses both price and volume to measure buying and selling pressure Typical Price = (High + Low + Close)/3 Money Flow = Typical Price x Volume Positive Money Flow = Sum of the money flows of all days where the typical price is greater than the previous day's typical price Negative Money Flow = Sum of the money flows of all days where the typical price is less than the previous day's typical price Money Flow Ratio = (14-period Positive Money Flow)/(14-period Negative Money Flow) Money Flow Index = 100 x Positive Money Flow / ( Positive Money Flow + Negative Money Flow)</p>
