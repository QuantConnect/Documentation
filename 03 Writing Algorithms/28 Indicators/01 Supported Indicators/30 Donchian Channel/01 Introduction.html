<!-- Code generated by indicator_reference_code_generator.py -->
<p>This indicator computes the upper and lower band of the Donchian Channel. The upper band is computed by finding the highest high over the given period. The lower band is computed by finding the lowest low over the given period. The primary output value of the indicator is the mean of the upper and lower band for the given timeframe.</p>
