<p>This indicator represents the Tom Demark Sequential indicator, which is used to identify potential trend exhaustion points. This implementation tracks both the setup and countdown phases, and can be extended to handle bullish and bearish setups, as well as qualifiers such as Perfect Setups and Countdown completions. - **Setup Phase**: Detects a trend by counting 9 consecutive bars where the close is less than (Buy Setup) or greater than (Sell Setup) the close 4 bars earlier. - **TDST Support/Resistance**: After a valid 9-bar setup completes, the indicator records the **lowest low** (for Sell Setup) or **highest high** (for Buy Setup) among the 9 bars. These are referred to as Support Price(for Buy Setup) and Resistance Price (for Sell Setup), and serve as critical thresholds that validate the continuation of the countdown phase. - **Countdown Phase**: Once a valid setup is completed, the indicator attempts to count 13 qualifying bars (not necessarily consecutive) where the close is less than (Buy Countdown) or greater than (Sell Countdown) the low/high 2 bars earlier. During this phase, the TDST Support/Resistance levels are checked — if the price breaks these levels, the countdown phase is reset, as the trend reversal condition is considered invalidated.</p>
