<p>This indicator represents the traditional exponential moving average indicator (EMA). When the indicator is ready, the first value of the EMA is equivalent to the simple moving average. After the first EMA value, the EMA value is a function of the previous EMA value. Therefore, depending on the number of samples you feed into the indicator, it can provide different EMA values for a single security and lookback period. To make the indicator values consistent across time, warm up the indicator with all the trailing security price history.</p>
