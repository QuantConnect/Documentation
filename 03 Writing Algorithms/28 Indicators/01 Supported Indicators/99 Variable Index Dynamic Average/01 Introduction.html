<p>This indicator computes the n-period adaptive weighted moving average indicator. VIDYAi = Pricei x F x ABS(CMOi) + VIDYAi-1 x (1 - F x ABS(CMOi)) where: VIDYAi - is the value of the current period. Pricei - is the source price of the period being calculated. F = 2/(Period_EMA+1) - is a smoothing factor. ABS(CMOi) - is the absolute current value of CMO. VIDYAi-1 - is the value of the period immediately preceding the period being calculated.</p>
