<p>The Awesome Oscillator Indicator tracks the price midpoint-movement of a security. Specifically, <para> AO = MAfast[(H+L)/2] - MAslow[(H+L)/2] </para> where MAfast and MAslow denote simple moving averages wherein fast has a shorter period. https://www.barchart.com/education/technical-indicators/awesome_oscillator</p>
