        "description": "This indicator represents the traditional Weighted Moving Average indicator. The weight are linearly distributed according to the number of periods in the indicator. For example, a 4 period indicator will have a numerator of (4 * window[0]) + (3 * window[1]) + (2 * window[2]) + window[3] and a denominator of 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 During the warm up period, IsReady will return False, but the LWMA will still be computed correctly because the denominator will be the minimum of Samples factorial or Size factorial and the computation iterates over that minimum value. The RollingWindow of inputs is created when the indicator is created. A RollingWindow of LWMAs is not saved. That is up to the caller.",
