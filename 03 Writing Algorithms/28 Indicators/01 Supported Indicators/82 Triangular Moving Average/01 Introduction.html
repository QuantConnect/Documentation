<p>This indicator computes the Triangular Moving Average (TRIMA). The Triangular Moving Average is calculated with the following formula: (1) When the period is even, TRIMA(x,period)=SMA(SMA(x,period/2),(period/2)+1) (2) When the period is odd, TRIMA(x,period)=SMA(SMA(x,(period+1)/2),(period+1)/2)</p>
