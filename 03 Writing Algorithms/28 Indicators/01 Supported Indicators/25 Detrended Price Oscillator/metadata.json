        "description": "The Detrended Price Oscillator is an indicator designed to remove trend from price and make it easier to identify cycles. DPO does not extend to the last date because it is based on a displaced moving average. Is estimated as Price {X/2 + 1} periods ago less the X-period simple moving average. E.g.DPO(20) equals price 11 days ago less the 20-day SMA.",
