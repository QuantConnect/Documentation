<p>An Autoregressive Intergrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is a time series model which can be used to describe a set of data. In particular,with Xₜ representing the series, the model assumes the data are of form (after differencing <see cref="F:QuantConnect.Indicators.AutoRegressiveIntegratedMovingAverage._diffOrder" /> times): <para> Xₜ = c + εₜ + ΣᵢφᵢXₜ₋ᵢ + Σᵢθᵢεₜ₋ᵢ </para> where the first sum has an upper limit of <see cref="F:QuantConnect.Indicators.AutoRegressiveIntegratedMovingAverage._arOrder" /> and the second <see cref="F:QuantConnect.Indicators.AutoRegressiveIntegratedMovingAverage._maOrder" />.</p>
