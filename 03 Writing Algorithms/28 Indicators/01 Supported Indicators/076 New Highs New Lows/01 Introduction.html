<p>The NewHighsNewLows is a New Highs / New Lows indicator that accepts IBaseDataBar data as its input. This type is more of a shim/typedef to reduce the need to refer to things as NewHighsNewLows&lt;IBaseDataBar&gt;</p>
<p>To view the implementation of this indicator, see the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/tree/master/Indicators/NewHighsNewLows.cs">LEAN GitHub repository</a>.</p>
