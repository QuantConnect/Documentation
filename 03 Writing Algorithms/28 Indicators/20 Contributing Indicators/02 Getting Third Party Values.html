<p>As a quantitative algorithmic trading engine, accuracy and reliability are very important to Lean. We required third-party source values as reference points to contrast the calculated values of the created indicators. This ensures that the custom indicator implementation is correct.
 The below includes some examples of accepted third-party sources.</p>

<h4>Renown Open-source Projects</h4>
<p>Developed and maintained by expert teams, these sources undergo rigorous testing and optimization, ensuring accurate calculations. The transparent nature of open-source projects allows for community scrutiny, resulting in bug fixes and continuous improvements.
 Open-source Projects provide detailed information on how the indicator values are calculated, which provides excellent reproducibility. Thus, we accept values from these projects with high confidence. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>TA-Lib</li>
    <li>QuantLib</li>
</ul>

<h4>Highly Credible Websites</h4>
<p>Similar reasons applied to these websites as well. They should be either original sources or very popular trading data providers, such that we have confidence in their accuracy and reliability.
 These sources might provide structured data samples, like a JSON response, CSV or Excel file, or scripts for calculating the indicator values.</p>
