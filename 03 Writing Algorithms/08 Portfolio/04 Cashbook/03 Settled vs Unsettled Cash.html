<p>The <code class="csharp">Portfolio</code><code class="python">portfolio</code> has two independent cashbooks. The <code class="csharp">CashBook</code><code class="python">cash_book</code> tracks settled cash and the <code class="csharp">UnsettledCashBook</code><code class="python">unsettled_cash_book</code> tracks unsettled cash, which you can't spend. If you trade with a margin account, trades settle immediately so LEAN credits and debits the <code class="csharp">CashBook</code><code class="python">cash_book</code> at the time of the trade. In some cases, transactions can take time to settle. For example, Equity trades in a cash account settle in T+3. Therefore, if you sell shares of stock on Monday, the transaction settles on Thursday. In contrast, Option trades settle in T+1. <br></p>
