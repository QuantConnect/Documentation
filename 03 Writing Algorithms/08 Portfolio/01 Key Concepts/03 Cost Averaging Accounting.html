<p>LEAN uses the cost averaging accounting method, which determines the cost of your holdings by taking a weighted average of all your purchase prices. For example, say you place the following buy orders:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Buy 10 ABC @ $10</li>
    <li>Buy 5 ABC @ $11</li>
    <li>Buy 20 ABC @ $14</li>
    <li>Buy 3 ABC @ $9</li>
</ol>

<p>In the preceding example, the average cost of your ABC position is (10*10 + 5*11 + 20*14 + 3*9) / (10 + 5 + 20 + 3) = 12.1579/share. In contrast, if you use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) accounting method, the cost of the first 10 shares is 10/share, not 12.1579/share.</p>

<p>To get the cost of your security holdings, use the <code class="csharp">HoldingsCost</code><code class="python">holdings_cost</code> property of the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/portfolio/holdings">SecurityHolding object</a>. If you fill buy and sell orders, the holdings cost is the product of the holding quantity and the average price. For example, the following table shows how the average price and holdings cost changes with each buy and sell order order in a long position:</p>

<table class="qc-table table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Order Quantity</th>

<p>Note that when you decrease the position size without closing the trade, the average price doesn't change because the denominator and the coefficients in the numerator of its formula are scaled by the quotient of the current holding quantity and the previous holding quantity. For instance, if the last row in the preceding table had an order quantity 1, the holding quantity would be -1 and the average price would be</p>
