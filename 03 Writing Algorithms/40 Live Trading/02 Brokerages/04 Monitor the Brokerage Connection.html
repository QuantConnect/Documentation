<p>We notify your algorithm when your brokerage connection disconnects and reconnects.</p>

<h4>Lost Connections<br></h4>
<p>If the brokerage connection breaks, we notify your algorithm through the <code class="csharp">OnBrokerageDisconnect</code><code class="python">on_brokerage_disconnect</code> event handler.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Track brokerage connection status using the OnBrokerageDisconnect event handler to aid in troubleshooting and monitor connectivity issues.
public override void OnBrokerageDisconnect() 
{
    Debug("Brokerage connection lost");
}</pre>
<pre class="python"># Track brokerage connection status using the on_brokerage_disconnect event handler to aid in troubleshooting and monitor connectivity issues.
def on_brokerage_disconnect(self) -&gt; None:
    self.debug("Brokerage connection lost")</pre>
</div>

<h4>Restored Connections<br></h4>
<p>When the brokerage connection restores after it disconnects, we notify your algorithm through the <code class="csharp">OnBrokerageReconnect</code><code class="python">on_brokerage_reconnect</code> event handler.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Track when the brokerage connection is restored using the OnBrokerageReconnect event handler to monitor and confirm connectivity restoration.
public override void OnBrokerageReconnect() 
{
    Debug("Brokerage connection restored");
}</pre>
<pre class="python"># Track when the brokerage connection is restored using the on_brokerage_reconnect event handler to monitor and confirm connectivity restoration.
def on_brokerage_reconnect(self) -&gt; None:
    self.debug("Brokerage connection restored")</pre>
</div>

<p>When LEAN reconnects with your brokerage, it synchronizes the state of your live orders. For example, say the brokerage fills your limit order during the period of disconnection. When the connection restores, LEAN updates the state of your portfolio and orders to reflect the filled order, but you won't receive an <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-events">order event</a>.</p>
