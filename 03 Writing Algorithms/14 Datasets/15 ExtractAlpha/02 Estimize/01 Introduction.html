<p>The Estimize dataset by ExtractAlpha estimates the financials of companies, including EPS, and revenues. The data covers over 2,800 US-listed Equities’ EPS/Revenue. The data starts in January 2011 and is updated on a daily frequency. The data is sparse, and it doesn't have new updates every day. This dataset is crowdsourced from a community of 100,000+ contributors via the data provider’s web platform.</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>
