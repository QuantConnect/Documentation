<p>The Corporate Buybacks dataset by Smart Insider tracks US Equities share buyback programs. The data covers 3,000 US Equities, starts in May 2015, and is delivered on a second frequency. This dataset is created by analyzing daily buyback announcements and by using secondary data sources to ensure records are accurate and complete.</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>
