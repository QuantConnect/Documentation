<p> The NFT Sales dataset by CryptoSlam! provides Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) sales volume data in various blockchain marketplaces. This dataset covers 11 blockchains that have their own native Cryptocurrencies. The data starts in June 2017 and is delivered on a daily frequency. This dataset fetches the number of transactions, unique buyers, unique sellers, and the dollar volume of NFT transactions on all secondary marketplaces tracked by CryptoSlam, which includes owner-to-owner sales only (not initial sales from the product directly to the owners).
