<p>The Tactical dataset by ExtractAlpha is a stock scoring algorithm that captures the technical dynamics of individual US Equities over one to ten trading day horizons. It can assist a longer-horizon investor in timing their entry or exit points or be used in combination with existing systematic or qualitative strategies with similar holding periods.</p>

<p>The data covers a dynamic universe of around 4,700 US Equities per day on average, starts in January 2000, and is delivered on a daily frequency. The Tactical dataset expands upon simple reversal, liquidity, and seasonality factors to identify stocks that are likely to trend or reverse.</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>
