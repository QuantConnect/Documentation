<p>The US Coarse Universe dataset by QuantConnect is a daily universe of all trading stocks in the US for a given day with the end of day price and volume. The data covers 30,000 US Equities in total, with approximately 8,000 Equities per day. The data starts in January 1998 and is delivered each trading day. This dataset is created by taking the closing auction price tick from the daily L1 trade and quote exchange dumps.
