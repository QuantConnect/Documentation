The US Equity Option Universe dataset by QuantConnect lists the available US Equity Options contracts and the current Implied Volatility and Greeks. The data covers 4,000 Symbols, starts in January 2012, and is delivered on a daily update frequency. To create this dataset, we use <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/research/16977/greeks-and-iv-implementation/p1'>our implementation</a> of the forward tree pricing model, which accounts for the interest rate, dividend payments, and daily closing prices. The values in this dataset are the same values you can get from daily <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/asset-classes/equity-options/greeks-and-implied-volatility/indicators'>indicators</a> with mirror Options.

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes of the underlying security.</p>

<p>This dataset <b>does not</b> contain market data. For market data, see <a href="/datasets/algoseek-us-equity-options">US Equity Options by AlgoSeek</a>.</p>
