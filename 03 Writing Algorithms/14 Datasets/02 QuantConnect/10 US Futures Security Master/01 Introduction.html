<p>The US Futures Security Master dataset by QuantConnect provides mapping reference data for the most liquid contracts of the CME Group exchanges, calculated with popular rolling techniques. The data covers 162 root Future contracts, starts in 2012, and is delivered on a daily frequency with a zip file with all the contract mappings. This dataset is created by daily processing of the US historical Future chains.</p>

<p>This dataset, paired with the US Futures dataset, supports the following rolling techniques: forward panama canal, backwards panama canal, and backwards ratio. You can set the specific rolling date to occur on the last trading day, first day month, or the day when the contract with the greatest open interest changes.</p>

<p>VIX Futures don't support continous contract rolling with open interest.</p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> the underlying Futures data (<a href='/datasets/algoseek-us-futures'>US Futures</a> dataset), which you need to purchase separately with a license from AlgoSeek. This security master dataset is required to purchase the US Futures or US Future Options datasets.</p>
