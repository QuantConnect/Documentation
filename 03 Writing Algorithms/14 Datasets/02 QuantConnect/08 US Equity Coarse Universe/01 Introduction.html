<p>The US Equity Coarse Universe dataset by QuantConnect is a daily universe of all trading stocks in the US for a given day with the end of day price and volume. The data covers 30,000 US Equities in total, with approximately 8,000 Equities per day. The data starts in January 1998 and is delivered each trading day. This dataset is created by taking the closing auction price tick from the daily L1 trade and quote exchange dumps.

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="/datasets/algoseek-us-equities">US Equities by AlgoSeek</a> dataset because <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/universes/key-concepts#02-How-Universe-Selection-Works">universe selection</a> adds and removes market data subscriptions and on the <a href="/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>

<p>QuantConnect/LEAN combines the data of this dataset with <a href="/datasets/morning-star-us-fundamentals">MorningStar Fundamental data</a> in runtime. You can use this dataset in local development without the Morningstar counterpart.</p>
