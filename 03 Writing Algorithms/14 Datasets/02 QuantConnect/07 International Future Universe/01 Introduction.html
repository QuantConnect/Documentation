<p>The International Future Universe dataset by QuantConnect lists the available International Future contracts, their daily trading volume, and Open Interest. The data covers 3 contracts (FESX, HSI, and NKD), starts in July 1998, and is delivered on daily frequency. This dataset is created by monitoring the trading activity on the EUREX, HKFE, and CME.

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href='/datasets/quantconnect-us-futures-security-master'>US Futures Security Master</a> dataset because the US Futures Security Master dataset contains information on symbol changes of the contracts.</p>

<p>This dataset <code>does not</code> contain market data. For market data, see <a href="/datasets/tickdata-international-futures">International Futures by TickData</a> and <a href="/datasets/algoseek-us-future">US Futures by AlgoSeek</a> for NKD.</p>
