<p>If you download the files in the US Futures Security Master, you get a factor file and a map file for each of the exchanges with supported continuous Futures. To view the files, see the <i>\data\future\&lt;exchange_name&gt;</i> directory under your LEAN CLI base directory.</p>

<p>For the factor file, it is a <code>.zip</code> collection of REST API styled <code>.csv</code> files for each Future <code>Symbol</code>, including the date, scaling factors for each type of data normalization and the data mapping mode that indicates the Symbol changing event is on that day for that mapping mode. The following line is an example line in the <code>.csv</code> file:</p>
<code>{"Date":"2009-10-31T00:00:00","BackwardsRatioScale":[0.9914163090128755364806866953,1.0,1.0],"BackwardsPanamaCanalScale":[-2.0,0.0,0.0],"ForwardPanamaCanalScale":[0.0,0.0,0.0],"DataMappingMode":1}
</code>
<br /><p>For the map file, it is a <code>.zip</code> collection of <code>.csv</code> files for each Future <code>Symbol</code>, including the date, new underlying contract Symbol, the exchange code, and the data mapping mode that indicates the Symbol changing event is on that day for that mapping mode. The following line is an example line in the <code>.csv</code> file:</p>
