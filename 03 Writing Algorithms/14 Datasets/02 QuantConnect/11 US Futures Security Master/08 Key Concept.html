<p>The US Futures Security Master lets you to construct continuous Futures, allowing the access of normalized historical data of the underlying assets, as well as trading the “lead” Future contracts for those assets.</p>

<p>Continuous Futures refer to sets of rolling lead Future contracts during their actively trading periods. Since Future contracts expire at their maturities, to analyze the historical price of a Future and to apply technical indicators, you need the continuous Future price series.</p>

<p>To access the continuous Future, use the Future's <code class="csharp">Symbol</code><code class="python">symbol</code> property.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python"># Set the data normalization mode and data mapping mode to select the contract as the continuous contract with price adjustment for smooth price series
future = self.add_future(Futures.Energy.CRUDE_OIL_WTI,
    data_normalization_mode=DataNormalizationMode.BACKWARDS_RATIO,
    data_mapping_mode=DataMappingMode.OPEN_INTEREST,
    contract_depth_offset=0)
self.continuous_contract_symbol = future.symbol</pre>
<pre class="csharp">// Set the data normalization mode and data mapping mode to select the contract as the continuous contract with price adjustment for smooth price series
var future = AddFuture(Futures.Energy.CrudeOilWTI,
    dataNormalizationMode: DataNormalizationMode.BackwardsRatio,
    dataMappingMode: DataMappingMode.OpenInterest,
    contractDepthOffset: 0
);
_continuousFutureSymbol = future.Symbol;</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>dataNormalizationMode</code> and <code>dataMappingMode</code> arguments makes the transition of the underlying contracts seemless. However, the Future <code>Symbol</code> doesn't map to an underlying Future contract. It works fine to trade within backtests, but could be subjected to friction costs during live trading since the order price could be a normalized price.
