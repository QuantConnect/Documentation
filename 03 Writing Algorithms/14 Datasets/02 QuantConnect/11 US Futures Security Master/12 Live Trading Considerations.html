<p>You can trade continuous Futures, but the continuous Future <code>Symbol</code> doesn't map to a single underlying Future contract. Instead, it represents a set of rolling contracts. Thus, the prices could be frictional during a contract rollover, which could be catastrophic in live trading! For live trading, you should place your orders directly on the underlying contracts. To get the current underlying contract in the continuous Future series, use the <code class="csharp">Mapped</code><code class="python">mapped</code> property.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python"># Get the mapped symbol
current_contract = self.continuous_contract.mapped
self.buy(current_contract, 1)</pre>
<pre class="csharp">// Get the mapped symbol
var currentContract = _continuousContract.Mapped;
Buy(currentContract, 1);</pre>
</div>
