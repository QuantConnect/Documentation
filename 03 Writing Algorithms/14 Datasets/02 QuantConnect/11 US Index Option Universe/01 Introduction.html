The US Index Option Universe dataset by QuantConnect lists the available US Index Options contracts and the current Implied Volatility and Greeks. The data covers European Option contracts for 3 US Indices: SPX, VIX, and NDX. It starts in January 2012 and is delivered on a daily update frequency. To create this dataset, we use <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/research/16977/greeks-and-iv-implementation/p1'>our implementation</a> of the forward tree pricing model, which accounts for the interest rate, dividend payments, and daily closing prices. The values in this dataset are the same values you can get from daily <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/asset-classes/index-options/greeks-and-implied-volatility/indicators'>indicators</a> with mirror Options.
