<p>The VIX Central Contango dataset by VIX Central tracks VIX Futures (VX) contango data. The data covers 12 Futures contracts closest to expiry/maturity, starts in June 2010, and is delivered on a daily frequency. The dataset is created by QuantConnect downloading data from VIX Central website, which collects and analyses VIX and VX (VIX Futures) data.</p>

<p>Contango and Backwardation are terms used to describe if participants in the Futures market are overpaying or underpaying relative to the "spot" price of the underlying commodity when trading a Futures contract ("spot" price is the price of the actual commodity/asset at a given moment in time). Contango and backwardation can be used to determine forward-looking expectations of the commodity's spot price by the time the Future has expired/matured and is set to be delivered by participants of the Futures market. As Futures near their expiration/maturity date, contango and backwardation curves tend to converge on the spot price of the commodity at the time of expiration.</p>
