<p>The US Equities dataset by AlgoSeek is survivorship bias-free daily coverage of every stock traded in the US Securities Information Processors (SIP) CTA/UTP feed since 1998. The dataset covers approximately 27,500 securities, starts in January 1998, and is delivered in any resolution from tick to daily. The Data is collected from the full SIP feed via our Equinix co-located servers, including all trades and quotes published to every exchange as well as FINRA. Over-the-Counter (OTC) trades are not included.</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>
