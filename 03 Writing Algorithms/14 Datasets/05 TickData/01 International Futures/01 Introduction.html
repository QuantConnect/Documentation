<p>The International Futures dataset by TickData provides Futures data, including price, volume, open interest, and expiry. The data covers the 3 contracts, FESX, HSI, and NKD, starting in July 1998 and is delivered on any frequency from tick to daily. This dataset is created by TickData, which negotiates directly with exchanges for their official archive and partners with real-time data providers with direct exchange connections and multiple redundant ticker plants.</p>

<p>This dataset also depends on the <a href='/datasets/quantconnect-us-futures-security-master'>US Futures Security Master</a> because the US Futures Security Master dataset contains information to construct continuous Futures.</p>
