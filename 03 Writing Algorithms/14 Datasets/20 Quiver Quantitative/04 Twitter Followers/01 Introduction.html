<p>The Twitter Followers dataset by Quiver Quantitative tracks the number of followers on the official Twitter pages of US-listed companies. The data covers 2,000 equities, starts in May 2020, and is delivered on a daily frequency. This dataset is created by scraping the number of Twitter followers from the official Twitter page of the security.</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>
