<p>The Corporate Lobbying dataset by Quiver Quantitative tracks the lobbying activity of US Equities. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 requires lobbyists in the United States to disclose information about their activities, such as their clients, which issues they are lobbying on, and how much they are being paid. Quiver Quantiative scrapes this data and maps it to stock tickers to track which companies are spending money for legislative influence. For more information about this dataset, see <a href="https://www.quiverquant.com/blog/030121">The Effects and Influence of Corporate Lobbying</a> on the Quiver Quantitative website.</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>
