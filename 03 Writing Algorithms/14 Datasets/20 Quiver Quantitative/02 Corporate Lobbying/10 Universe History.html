<p>You can get historical universe data in an algorithm and in the Research Environment.</p>

<h4>Historical Universe Data in Algorithms</h4>
<p>To get historical universe data in an algorithm, call the <b>History</b> method with the <b>Universe</b> object and the lookback period. If there is no data in the period you request, the history result is empty.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
        <pre class="csharp">var universeHistory = History(universe, 30, Resolution.Daily);
foreach (var lobbyings in universeHistory)
{
    foreach (QuiverLobbyingUniverse lobbying in lobbyings)
    {
        Log($"{lobbying.Symbol} issue at {lobbying.EndTime}: {lobbying.Issue}");
    }
}</pre>
     <pre class="python">universe_history = self.history(self.universe, 30, Resolution.DAILY)
for (symbol, time), lobbyings in universe_history.items():
    for lobbying in lobbyings:
        print(f"{lobbying.symbol} issue at {lobbying.end_time}: {lobbying.issue}")</pre>
</div>

<h4>Historical Universe Data in Research</h4>
<p>To get historical universe data in research, call the <b>UniverseHistory</b> method with the <b>Universe</b> object, a start date, and an end date. This method returns the filtered universe. If there is no data in the period you request, the history result is empty.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
        <pre class="csharp">var universeHistory = qb.UniverseHistory(universe, qb.Time.AddDays(-30), qb.Time);
foreach (var lobbyings in universeHistory)
{
    foreach (QuiverLobbyingUniverse lobbying in lobbyings)
    {
        Consolte.WriteLine($"{lobbying.Symbol} issue at {lobbying.EndTime}: {lobbying.Issue}");
    }
}</pre>
     <pre class="python">universe_history = qb.universe_history(universe, qb.time-timedelta(30), qb.time)
for (symbol, time), lobbyings in universe_history.items():
    for lobbying in lobbyings:
        print(f"{lobbying.symbol} issue at {lobbying.end_time}: {lobbying.issue}")</pre>
</div>
