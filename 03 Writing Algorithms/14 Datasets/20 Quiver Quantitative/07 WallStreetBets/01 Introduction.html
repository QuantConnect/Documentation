<p>The WallStreetBets dataset by Quiver Quantitative tracks daily mentions of different equities on Redditâ€™s popular WallStreetBets forum. The data covers 6,000 Equities, starts in August 2018, and is delivered on a daily frequency. The dataset is created by scraping the daily discussion threads on r/WallStreetBets and parsing the comments for ticker mentions.</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>
