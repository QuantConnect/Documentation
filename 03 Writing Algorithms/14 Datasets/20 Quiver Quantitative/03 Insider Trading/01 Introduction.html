<p>Corporate insiders are required to disclose purchases or sales of their own stock within two business days of when they occur. Using these disclosures, we collect data on insider trading activity, which can give hints on whether executives are bullish or bearish on their own companies.

Here is a blog that we did on this dataset: https://www.quiverquant.com/blog/081121
</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>
