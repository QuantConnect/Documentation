<p>The US Government Contracts dataset by Quiver Quantitative tracks the transactions of government contracts with publicly traded companies. The data covers over 700 US Equities, starts in October 2019, and is delivered on a daily frequency. Quiver Quantitative creates this dataset by using the API for <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/">USASpending.gov</a>, which has the official open data source of federal spending information. The rows in this dataset only show new contracts, not payments or modifications to existing contracts. The dollar amounts are based on the total dollars obligated from each contract.</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>
