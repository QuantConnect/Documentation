The Brain Wikipedia Page Views dataset by Brain tracks investor attention toward large U.S. equities by monitoring traffic on company Wikipedia pages. The dataset covers approximately 1,000 of the largest U.S. companies, broadly corresponding to the Russell 1000, and is available starting from February 2023. Data is delivered at a daily frequency.

The dataset is constructed by analyzing the number of views on each company’s Wikipedia page, including both the main page and any secondary pages that redirect to it. Only English-language Wikipedia pages are considered. The data is published daily, typically by 12:00 PM UTC, and reflects attention metrics calculated relative to the reporting date. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to raw page-view counts, the dataset includes buzz metrics, which normalize current attention levels relative to historical behavior. Buzz scores are computed as the distance between current page views and the company’s own historical average over the previous six months, expressed in units of standard deviations. As a result, positive buzz values indicate unusually high attention, while negative values indicate lower-than-normal attention. 
</p>
<p>
Metrics are provided across multiple time horizons, including 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day rolling windows, enabling users to study short-term spikes in attention as well as more persistent trends. These features make the dataset well-suited for research into investor attention, behavioral finance signals, event-driven strategies, and alpha models that incorporate information demand.

This dataset depends on the US Equity Security Master dataset, which provides essential information such as symbol mappings, corporate actions, and identifier consistency required for accurate historical analysis and backtesting.
