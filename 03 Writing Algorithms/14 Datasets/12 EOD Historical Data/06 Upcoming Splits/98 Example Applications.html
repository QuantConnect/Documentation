<p>
The Upcoming Splits dataset provides timely notifications about upcoming share split or reverse split events, allowing traders to capitalize on potential price movements and manage risks effectively. Examples include the following strategies: 
</p>

<ul><li>Splits into shares with lower price will provide higher liquidity for market making algorithms.</li>
<li>Select a universe of stocks with upcoming splits event and trade their volatility using options.</li>
<li>Buy stocks with split factor higher than 1, sell vice versa for self-defeating ones.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Classic Algorithm Example</h4>
<p>The following example algorithm holds each equity in equal size with upcoming splits within 7 days. It selects stocks that split up to more shares with lower price and tries to capitalize the higher demand of the more afforable stocks.</p>
