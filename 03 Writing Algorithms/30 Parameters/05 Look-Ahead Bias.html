<p>Look-ahead bias occurs when an algorithm makes decisions using data that would not have yet been available. For instance, in optimization jobs, you optimize a set of parameters over a historical backtesting period. After the optimizer finds the optimal parameter values, the backtest period becomes part of the in-sample data. If you run a backtest over the same period using the optimal parameters, look-ahead bias has seeped into your research. In reality, it would not be possible to know the optimal parameters during the testing period until after the testing period is over. To avoid issues with look-ahead bias, optimize on older historical data and test the optimal parameter values on recent historical data. Alternatively, apply walk forward optimization to optimize the parameters on smaller batches of history.</p>
