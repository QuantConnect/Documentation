<p>The following examples demonstrate some common practices for requesting Futures universe data.</p>

<h4>Example 1: Rollover</h4>
<p>Future contracts expire monthly or quarterly in most cases. Hence, if we hold Future position in month or quarter end, we must consider rolling over to the mapped contract. The following algorithm shows how to buy and roll over to the next front month Future contract. We make use of the universe selection filter to select the front month contract and order the next mapped contract during the previous one expires.</p>

<h4>Example 2: Continuous Future Indicator</h4>
<p>One of the major applications of <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/universes/futures#12-Continous-Contracts'>Continuous Future</a> is to obtain smooth price series to feed into indicators. This can ensure the indicator gets the correct price data that is comparable to the current mapped Future contract. In this example, we demonstrate a 252-day <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/supported-indicators/exponential-moving-average">Exponential Moving Average indicator</a> update using continuous ES contract data.</p>

<h4>Example 3: Contango</h4>
<p>In Future trading, contango refers to the far-to-expiry Future contract price is higher than the spot price due to various reasons, such as storage fee and insurance of the commodities. The following example shows a contango trading by shorting the far contract that the price is above a threshold compared to the front month contract price and buying the front month contract to earn the premium in between.</p>
