<p>Option Greeks represent the changes of an option's price concerning changes in specific parameters. They serve as indicators of the sensitivity of an option's value to variations in these parameters, effectively quantifying the impact of each component on the final option price. The table below outlines some of the most commonly used Option Greeks:</p>

<p>Option Greeks are the partial derivatives of the option price. Therefore, their values are also a function of the IV. This stresses the importance of an accurate IV model to obtain accurate Greeks, hence accurate hedge size calculation for option hedging methods like Delta hedging.</p>
