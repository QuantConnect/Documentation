<p>The "volatility smile" is a term used in finance to describe a particular shape that can be observed when plotting IV against strike prices for options that share the same expiration date.
Typically, when you plot IVs against strike prices, the curve tends to be concave, resembling a smile. This means that options with strike prices significantly above or below the current market price of the underlying asset tend to have higher IV than options with strike prices closer to the current market price.</p>

<p>Several theories attempt to explain the existence of the volatility smile. One explanation is that it arises from adjustments to the classic Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model, which assumes that asset prices follow a log-normal distribution. The volatility smile suggests that the market anticipates a higher probability of extreme price movements (fat tails) than the BSM model predicts. Another explanation is related to market dynamics and the demand for hedging. 
During periods of heightened market volatility, the volatility smile tends to become steeper, indicating a greater disparity in implied volatilities across different strike prices. This means that options, particularly those with out-of-the-money strike prices, become more expensive as investors seek protection against potential market downturns or increased price fluctuations. As a result, the volatility smile can serve as a valuable tool for investors and traders to assess market sentiment and gauge the level of risk in their portfolios.</p>

<p>According to some volatility models, such as the Heston model, the IV smile/surface should exhibit a smooth pattern. Any deviations from this smoothness, such as non-smooth spikes or irregularities, may signal potential arbitrage opportunities for traders.</p>

<h4>Volatility Smirk</h4>
<p>However, in some cases, rather than a traditional U-shaped curve, traders may observe what's known as a "smirk." This smirk occurs when the implied volatilities for higher-strike options are lower than those for ATM and lower-strike options. This deviation from the typical volatility smile pattern indicates a market expectation of a significant downward movement in the underlying asset's price. 
Traders interpret this as a signal that investors are allocating funds towards options with higher probabilities of such downward movements, resulting in increased demand for lower-strike options.</p>
