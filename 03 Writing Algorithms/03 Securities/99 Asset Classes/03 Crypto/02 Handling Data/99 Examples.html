<p>
 The following examples demonstrate some common practices for handling Crypto data.
</p>
<h4>
 Example 1: Dollar Cost Average BTC
</h4>
<p>
 Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is where you consistently invest a fixed dollar amount into an asset on a regular basis (for example, monthly), regardless of the asset's price. 
	It can reduce the volatility in your PnL due to slowly increasing the position size over time. 
	The following algorithm demonstrates a DCA investment into BTC. 
	It buys $10,000 USD worth of BTC every midnight for 30 consecutive days.

<h4>
 Example 2: Inter-Market Spread
</h4>
<p>
 There is always a small discrepancy in the price of the same Crypto pair trading on different exchanges. 
	Although you can't currently live trade on algorithm with multiple brokerages, you can study the cointegration pattern and implement 2 live nodes to capture the arbitrage opportunity. 
	The following algorithm demonstrates how to obtain the spread between the BTCUSD pair on Kraken and on Coinbase:

        _krakenBtc = AddCrypto("BTCUSD", market: Market.Kraken).Symbol;
        _coinbaseBtc = AddCrypto("BTCUSD", market: Market.Coinbase).Symbol;
    }

    public override void OnData(Slice slice)
    {
        // Only calculate the spread if the prices on both exchanges are in the current Slice.
        if (slice.Bars.ContainsKey(_krakenBtc) &amp;&amp; slice.Bars.ContainsKey(_coinbaseBtc))
        {
            // Calculate the spread between the 2 exchanges, making sure the comparison is always in the same direction.
            var spread = slice.Bars[_krakenBtc].Close - slice.Bars[_coinbaseBtc].Close;
