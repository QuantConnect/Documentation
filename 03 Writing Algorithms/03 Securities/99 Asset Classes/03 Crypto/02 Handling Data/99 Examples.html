<p>The following examples demonstrate some common practices for handling Crypto data.</p>

<h4>Example 1: Dollar Cost Average BTC</h4>
<p>
	Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is where you consistently invest a fixed dollar amount into an asset on a regular basis (for example, monthly), regardless of the asset's price. 
	It can reduce the volatility in your PnL due to slowly increasing the position size over time. 
	The following algorithm demonstrates a DCA investment into BTC. 
	It buys $10,000 USD worth of BTC every midnight for 30 consecutive days.

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">public class CryptoExampleAlgorithm : QCAlgorithm
{
    private Symbol _symbol;
    // Set a day count variable for counting the days of the DCA trade.
    private int _dayCount = 0;

    public override void Initialize()
    {
        // Set the brokerage and account type to match your brokerage environment for accurate fee and margin behavior.
        SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.Bitfinex, AccountType.Cash);
        // For daily DCA purchases, subscribe to daily asset data.
        _symbol = AddCrypto("BTCUSD", Resolution.Daily).Symbol;
    }

    public override void OnData(Slice slice)
    {
        // If you haven't invested for 30 consecutive days yet, continue buying.
        if (slice.Bars.ContainsKey(_symbol) && _dayCount++ &lt; 30)
        {
            // Calculate the order size for $10,000 USD using the current price.
            var size = 10000m / slice.Bars[_symbol].Close;
            MarketOrder(_symbol, size);
        }
    }
}</pre>
	<pre class="python">class CryptoExampleAlgorithm(QCAlgorithm):
    def initialize(self) -&gt; None:
        # Set a day count variable for counting the days of the DCA trade.
        self.day_count = 0
        # Set the brokerage and account type to match your brokerage environment for accurate fee and margin behavior.
        self.set_brokerage_model(BrokerageName.BITFINEX, AccountType.CASH)
        # For daily DCA purchases, subscribe to daily asset data.

            size = 10000 / slice.bars[self._symbol].close
            self.market_order(self._symbol, size)
    
            # Increase the day count.
            self.day_count += 1</pre>

<h4>Example 2: Inter-Market Spread</h4>
<p>
	There is always a small discrepancy in the price of the same Crypto pair trading on different exchanges. 
	Although you can't currently live trade on algorithm with multiple brokerages, you can study the cointegration pattern and implement 2 live nodes to capture the arbitrage opportunity. 
	The following algorithm demonstrates how to obtain the spread between the BTCUSD pair on Kraken and on Coinbase:

	<pre class="csharp">public class CryptoExampleAlgorithm : QCAlgorithm
{
    private Symbol _krakenBtc;
    private Symbol _coinbaseBtc;

    public override void Initialize()
    {
        // Add subscription of BTC-USD of 2 different exchanges in order to obtain the inter-market spread
        _krakenBtc = AddCrypto("BTCUSD", market: Market.Kraken).Symbol;
        _coinbaseBtc = AddCrypto("BTCUSD", market: Market.Coinbase).Symbol;
    }

    public override void OnData(Slice slice)
    {
        // Only compare the price if prices of both exchanges are updated for fair comparison
        if (slice.Bars.ContainsKey(_krakenBtc) && slice.Bars.ContainsKey(_coinbaseBtc))
        {
            // Calculate the spread between the 2 exchanges, make sure the comparison is always in the same direction
            var spread = slice.Bars[_krakenBtc].Close - slice.Bars[_coinbaseBtc].Close;
            // Plot the spread between the 2 exchanges in a custom plot and series by the plot and series name
            Plot("BTC Close Spread", "Spread", spread);
        }
    }

        self.coinbase_btc = self.add_crypto("BTCUSD", market=Market.COINBASE).symbol

    def on_data(self, slice: Slice) -&gt; None:

            # Calculate the spread between the 2 exchanges, make sure the comparison is always in the same direction.
            spread = slice.bars[self.kraken_btc].close - slice.bars[self.coinbase_btc].close
