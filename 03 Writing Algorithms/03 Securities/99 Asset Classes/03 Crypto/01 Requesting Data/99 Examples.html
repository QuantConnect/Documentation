<p>
 The following examples demonstrate some common practices for requesting Crypto data.
</p>
<h4>
 Example 1: Initialize Binance Algorithms
</h4>
<p>
 The following algorithm requests data for the BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT Crypto pairs on Binance. 
	The Binance
 <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages/key-concepts">
  brokerage model
 </a>
 provides realistic fee and fill modeling for the backtest.
	Since the quote currency of both pairs is USDT,
 <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/initialization#03-Set-Account-Currency">
  set the account currency
 </a>
 to USDT instead of USD.
	Otherwise, some order will fail since the brokerage doesn't automatically convert USD to USDT for you.
