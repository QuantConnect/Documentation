<p>The following examples demonstrate some common practices for requesting Crypto data.</p>

<h4>Example 1: Initialize Binance Algorithms</h4>
<p>
	The following algorithm requests data for the BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT Crypto pairs on Binance. 
	The Binance <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages/key-concepts'>brokerage model</a> provides realistic fee and fill modeling for the backtest.
	Since the quote currency of both pairs is USDT, <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/initialization#03-Set-Account-Currency'>set the account currency</a> to USDT instead of USD.
	Otherwise, some order will fail since the brokerage doesn't automatically convert USD to USDT for you.
