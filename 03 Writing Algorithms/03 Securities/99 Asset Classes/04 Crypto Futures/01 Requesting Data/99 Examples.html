<p>The following examples demonstrate some common practices for requesting Crypto Futures data.</p>

<h4>Example 1: Round To Lot</h4>
<p>Like Futures, Crypto Futures contracts have a fixed discrete size lot to trade instead of fractional like spot cryptos. Therefore, we will demonstrate how to order with the correct lot size to avoid rounding error. To access the lot size, call <code class="csharp">SymbolProperties</code><code class="python">symbol_properties</code> property of the <code>CryptoFuture</code> security object.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">private Symbol _symbol;

public override void Initialize()
{
    // Set brokerage and account type to match your brokerage environment for accurate fee and margin behavior
    SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.Binance, AccountType.Margin);
    // In Binance brokerage, USD is not a valid currency to trade or automatically convertable
    // Thus, we need to set account currency as USDT and add the starting cash
    SetAccountCurrency("USDT", 10000);
    // Add subscriptions to BTCUSDT Future with specific market to ensure the correct securities are selected
    _symbol = AddCryptoFuture("BTCUSDT", market: Market.Binance).Symbol;
}

public override void OnData(Slice slice)
{
    // Make sure to place order when market is open since market on open order is not accepted
    if (!Portfolio.Invested && IsMarketOpen(_symbol))
    {
        // Lot size data can be obtained in symbol properties
        // Placing an order rounded to the lot size ensures the order is valid and allows accurate calculation on profit and risk of the whole portfolio
        var lotSize = Securities[_symbol].SymbolProperties.LotSize;
        // This example demonstrate an initial desired order size of 2.5 contracts, which will be rounded to 2 contracts since the lot size = 1
        var quantity = Convert.ToDecimal(Math.Floor(2.5 / (double)lotSize)) * lotSize;
        MarketOrder(_symbol, quantity);
