<p>The following examples demonstrate some common practices for requesting Crypto Futures data.</p>

<h4>Example 1: Respect Lot Sizes</h4>
<p>
    Like Futures, Crypto Futures contracts have a fixed discrete lot size to trade instead of fractional like spot Crypto pairs. 
    The following algorithm demonstrates how to place orders that respect the lot size to avoid rounding errors.
