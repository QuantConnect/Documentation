<p>
 The following examples demonstrate some common practices for requesting Crypto Futures data.
</p>
<h4>
 Example 1: Respect Lot Sizes
</h4>
<p>
 Like Futures, Crypto Futures contracts have a fixed discrete lot size to trade instead of fractional like spot Crypto pairs. 
    The following algorithm demonstrates how to place orders that respect the lot size to avoid rounding errors.
