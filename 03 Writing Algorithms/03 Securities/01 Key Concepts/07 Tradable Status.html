<p>The <code>IsTradable</code> property shows whether you can trade a security. The property value is true when the security is in the universe, even if the data starts at a later day. Indices, canonical Option securities, and continuous Futures contracts are not tradable. In live mode, <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/importing-data/streaming-data/key-concepts'>custom data objects</a> are also not tradable, even if the custom data represents a tradable asset.</p>
