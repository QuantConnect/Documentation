<p>
    A security is an individual financial asset that you can trade on an exchange. 
    LEAN models these unique assets with a <code>Security</code> object, which the <code class="csharp">AddEquity</code><code class="python">add_equity</code>, <code class="csharp">AddCrypto</code><code class="python">add_crypto</code>, and similar methods return.
    The <code class="csharp">Securities</code><code class="python">securities</code> property of the <code>QCAlgorithm</code> class is a dictionary where the keys are <code>Symbol</code> objects and the values are <code>Security</code> objects. 
    The <code class="csharp">Securities</code><code class="python">securities</code> dictionary contains all of the securities that have been in the algorithm during its lifetime.
