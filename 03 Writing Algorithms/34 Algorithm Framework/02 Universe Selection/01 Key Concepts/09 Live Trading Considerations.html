<p>In live trading, the securities in your brokerage account are added to your user-defined universe. If your Universe Selection model doesn't select these securities, they are not removed from your user-defined universe. When you liquidate the positions, you can remove them from the user-defined universe. If you call the <code class="csharp">RemoveSecurity</code><code class="python">remove_security</code> method, it automatically liquidates the position.</p>

<p>To see the securities in your user-defined universe that were loaded from your brokerage account, check your algorithm's <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/universes/key-concepts#10-Active-Securities">ActiveSecurities</a> in the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/key-concepts/event-handlers#07-Warmup-Finished-Event'>OnWarmupFinished</a> event handler.</p>
