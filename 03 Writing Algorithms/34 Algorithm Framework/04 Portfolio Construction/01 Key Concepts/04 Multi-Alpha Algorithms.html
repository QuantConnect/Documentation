<p>If you add <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/alpha/key-concepts#03-Multi-Alpha-Algorithms">multiple Alpha models</a>, each alpha model receives the current slice in the order that you add the Alphas. The combined stream of Insight objects is passed to the Portfolio Construction model.</p>

<p>Each Portfolio Construction model has a unique method to combine Insight objects. The <code>PortfolioConstructionModel</code> doesn't combine information from Insight objects with the same <code>Symbol</code> and gets the last generated active one.</p>
