<p>In some cases, you may want to cancel an Insight. For example, if a <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/risk-management/key-concepts'>Risk Management model</a> in your algorithm liquidates a security, it should also cancel all of the active insights for the security. If you don't cancel the insights, the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/portfolio-construction/key-concepts'>Portfolio Construction model</a> might create a new <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/portfolio-construction/key-concepts#05-Portfolio-Targets'>PortfolioTarget</a> to re-enter the position.</p> 

<p>Another example of a situtation where you would want to cancel an Insight is when an <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/alpha/key-concepts'>Alpha model</a> in your algorithm determines the trading opportunity has pre-maturely ended. For instance, say you want your algorithm to enter a long position in a security when its <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/supported-indicators/relative-strength-index'>Relative Strength Index</a> (RSI) moves below 20 and then liquidate the position when the security's RSI moves above 30. If you emit an Insight that has a duration of 30 days when the RSI moves below 20 but the RSI moves above 30 in 10 days, you should cancel the Insight when the RSI moves above 30.</p>

<p>To cancel insights, call the <code class="csharp">Cancel</code><code class="python">cancel</code>/<code>Expire</code> method with a list of <code>Insight</code> objects.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python"># Cancel insights that are no longer relevant by passing them to the cancel method to prevent them from affecting decision-making.
algorithm.insights.cancel(insights)</pre>
    <pre class="csharp">// Cancel insights that are no longer relevant by passing them to the cancel method to prevent them from affecting decision-making.
algorithm.insights.cancel(insights);</pre>
</div>

<p>To cancel all the insights for some securities, call the <code class="csharp">Cancel</code><code class="python">cancel</code>/<code>Expire</code> method with a list of <code>Symbol</code> objects.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python"># Cancel all insights for securities that are no longer relevant by passing a list of Symbol Objects to the cancel/Expire method to prevent them from influencing decision-making.
algorithm.insights.cancel(symbols)</pre>
    <pre class="csharp">// Cancel all insights for securities that are no longer relevant by passing a list of Symbol Objects to the cancel/Expire method to prevent them from influencing decision-making.
algorithm.insights.cancel(symbols);</pre>
</div>

<p>When you cancel an active insight, it's <code class="csharp">CloseTimeUtc</code><code class="python">close_time_utc</code> property is set to one second into the past.</p>
