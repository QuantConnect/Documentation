<p>To add multiple Risk Management models, in the <code>Initialize</code> method, call the <code>AddRiskManagement</code> method multiple times.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">AddRiskManagement(new MaximumDrawdownPercentPerSecurity());
AddRiskManagement(new MaximumSectorExposureRiskManagementModel());</pre>
	<pre class="python">self.add_risk_management(MaximumDrawdownPercentPerSecurity())
self.add_risk_management(MaximumSectorExposureRiskManagementModel())</pre>
</div>

<p>If you add multiple Risk Management models, the original collection of <code>PortfolioTarget</code> objects from the Portfolio Construction model is passed to the first Risk Management model. The risk-adjusted targets from the first Risk Management model are passed to the second Risk Management model. The process continues sequentially until all of the Risk Management models have had an opportunity to adjust the targets.</p>
