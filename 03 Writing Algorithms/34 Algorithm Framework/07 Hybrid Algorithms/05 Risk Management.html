<p>
  Some Risk Management Models don't require a Portfolio Construction model to provide <code>PortfolioTarget</code> objects, allowing them to directly monitor the portfolio holdings and liquidate positions when neccessary. To see which pre-built Risk Management models don't need the Portfolio Construction model to provide <code>PortfolioTarget</code> objects, see <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/execution/supported-models">Supported Models</a>.

  You can add one or more Risk Management Models to your algorithm and it will operate normally. The following example initializes a classic algorithm with framework risk management models:
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">public override void Initialize()
{
    AddRiskManagement(new MaximumDrawdownPercentPerSecurity(0.05m));
    AddRiskManagement(new MaximumUnrealizedProfitPercentPerSecurity(0.1m));
}</pre>
	<pre class="python">def initialize(self):
    self.add_risk_management(MaximumDrawdownPercentPerSecurity(0.05))
    self.add_risk_management(MaximumUnrealizedProfitPercentPerSecurity(0.1))</pre>
</div>
