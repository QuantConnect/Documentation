<p>Implied volatility is the forecasted future volatility of a security. The Option price model uses the realized volatility to calculate the implied volatility. By default, it uses the formula from <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245065192_A_Simple_Formula_to_Compute_the_Implied_Standard_Deviation'>Brenner and Subrahmanyam (1988)</a> as the initial guess for implied volatility.</p>

\[ \frac{P}{S} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{T}} \]

<p>where \(P\) is the Option contract price, \(S\) is the underlying price, and \(T\) is the time until Option expiration.</p>

<p>If the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/options-models/volatility/key-concepts'>volatility model</a> of the underlying security is <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/options-models/volatility/key-concepts#07-Warm-Up-Models'>ready</a>, the price model uses its value as the initial guess for implied volatility and as an input to calculate the theoretical contract prices.</p>

<p>LEAN also provide an indicator implementation of <code>ImpliedVolatility</code>. It provides higher flexibility on option price model selection, <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/asset-classes/equity-options/greeks-and-implied-volatility/key-concepts#04-Volatility-Smile">volatility modeling</a> and allows implementation of <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/asset-classes/equity-options/greeks-and-implied-volatility/key-concepts#05-Volatility-Smoothing">IV smoothing</a> through call-put pair.
