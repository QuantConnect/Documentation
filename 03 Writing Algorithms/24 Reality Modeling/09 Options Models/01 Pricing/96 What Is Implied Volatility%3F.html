<p>Implied volatility is the forecasted future volatility of a security.</p> 
    
<p>
    LEAN provides an indicator implementation of implied volatility. 
    It provides higher flexibility on Option price model selection, <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/options-models/pricing#97-What-Is-Volatility-Smile3F">volatility modeling</a>, and allows <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/options-models/pricing#98-What-Is-Volatility-Smoothing3F">IV smoothing</a> through call-put pair.
    The <code>IndicatorBasedOptionPriceModel</code> use these indicators to calculate the implied volatility values. 
    For details, see <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/asset-classes/equity-options/greeks-and-implied-volatility/indicators#03-Implied-Volatility'>Implied Volatility</a>.

    The <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/options-models/pricing#07-Legacy-Models">legacy Option price models</a> use the realized volatility to calculate the implied volatility. By default, they use the formula from <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245065192_A_Simple_Formula_to_Compute_the_Implied_Standard_Deviation'>Brenner and Subrahmanyam (1988)</a> as the initial guess for implied volatility.</p>

\[ \frac{P}{S} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{T}} \]

<p>
    where \(P\) is the Option contract price, \(S\) is the underlying price, and \(T\) is the time until Option expiration. If the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/options-models/volatility/key-concepts'>volatility model</a> of the underlying security is <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/options-models/volatility/key-concepts#07-Warm-Up-Models'>ready</a>, the price model uses its value as the initial guess for implied volatility and as an input to calculate the theoretical contract prices.
