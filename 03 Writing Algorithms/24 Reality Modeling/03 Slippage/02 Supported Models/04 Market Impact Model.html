<p>The <code>MarketImpactSlippageModel</code> calculates the slippage with perspective to the market impact created by an order, which mimics the consumption of the order book and disruption of the supply-demand relationship at the microeconomic scale. 
The model is divided into distinct parts, the market impact estimation and the slippage that results from it.</p>

<h4>Factors to Consider</h4>
<p>The model includes factors that create market impact. <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href="https://www.ram-ai.com/sites/default/files/2022-06/costestim.pdf">Almgren, Thum, Hauptmann & Li (2005)</a> suggested the following factors:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Execution Time</li>
    <p>Asset price time series is usually considered as Random walk (with/without drift)
    $$S_t = S_{t-1} + f(S, t) + \epsilon$$
    or Brownian Motion
    $$S_t = S_0 + exp((\mu-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)t + \sigma W_t)$$
    In either model, the variance of predictions increases over time ($Var(S)=\sigma\sqrt{t}$). In fact, this happens to most stock price models. Thus, time uncertainty should also apply to the concept of slippage. The longer it takes to go from order submission to execution, the further the fill price will be from the price at order submission.</p>
    
    <li>Volatility of the Underlying Securities</li>
    <p>Like (1), the volatility also contributes to the uncertainty of the next price ($Var(S)=\sigma\sqrt{t}$). In most cases, volatility has a one-sided impact since the market's volatility is often introduced by overbuying or overselling from positive or negative sentiments.</p>
    
    <li>Liquidity</li>
    <p>Liquidity plays a crucial role in the supply-demand resilience. When a stock is liquid, an order usually only takes a small fraction of the market depth. Hence, the gap between the bid and ask price can be refilled quickly due to high market participation and a small gap. 
    However, when a stock is illiquid, a single order might already take the top few layers of the order book, creating a wide gap between the bid and ask price and volume, which makes a bigger shift in the equilibrium price. This will create an impact which is permanent in nature.</p>

    <li>Order Size</li>
    <p>Last but not least, the order size directly affects the proportion of the order book/liquidity that the order consumes. Moreover, the larger the order is, the longer it takes to fill since the market might not have sufficient depth. This has interaction effects with the preceding factors.</p>
</ol>    

<h4>Market Impact Decomposition</h4>
<p>In the book <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href="https://palomar.home.ece.ust.hk/papers/2016/Feng&Palomar-FnT2016.pdf">"A Signal Processing Perspective on Financial Engineering", Feng & Palomer (2015)</a> generalized scholars' opinions that market impact can be broken down into "permanent" and "temporary" components, with noise. 
The permanent impact of a trade refers to the price differences between equilibrium prices before and after the trade and the resilience of the order book. 
In contrast, temporary impact refers to the price difference between the instant price drop after a trade and the post-trade equilibrium.</p>

<img src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/market-impact-liquidity.png" class="docs-image" alt="Market impact under different liquidity situation">

<p>The model incorporates the preceding factors and estimates both the permanent and temporary impact components with two diffusion models as a function of $\nu=\frac{X}{VT}$, which is the normalized order size:
    $$G\left(\nu\right)=\pm\gamma\left|\nu\right|^\alpha+\text{noise}$$
    $$H\left(\nu\right)=\pm\eta\left|\nu\right|^\beta+\text{noise}$$
    where $X$ is the order quantity, $V$ is the average daily volume, and $T$ is the time difference between order submission and filling (execution time). The other symbols are parameters that are calibrated from historical trade data. Together with the execution time, daily volatility $\sigma$, and liquidity factor $\delta$, the complete models are as follows:
    $$I=\sigma T \gamma\left|\frac{X}{VT}\right|^\alpha\left(\frac{\Theta}{V}\right)^\delta+\sigma\sqrt{T_{\text{post}}}\epsilon$$
    $$J=\sigma T \eta\left|\frac{X}{VT}\right|^\beta+\sigma\sqrt{T_{\text{post}}}\epsilon$$
    where $\Theta$ is the share outstanding, $T_{post}$ is the time difference between order submission and the new equilibrium established, $I$ is the permanent market impact, and $J$ is the temporary market impact. The inverse of the turnover rate $\frac{\Theta}{V}$ contributes to the permanent impact. This relationship is reasonable since higher turnover means more market participants are in the market, so the order book depth is deeper.</p>

<p>The authors also posted their calibrated parameters, which are the default parameters of the model. Note that there are so shortfall of the default parameters:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The default parameters are calibrated around 2 decades ago</li>
    <li>The trading time effect is not accounted (volume near market open/close is larger)</li>
    <li>The market environment does not have many market makers at that time</li>
</ul>
<p>So it is recommend to recalibrate with reference to the original paper.</p>
