<p>The following examples demonstrate common practices for implementing a custom brokerage message handler.</p>

<h4>Example 1: Notification</h4>
<p>The following algorithm buys and holds SPY. It implemented a custom brokerage message handler to send notifications to users through email and SMS in cases of disconnection, reconnections, and outside trades.</p>
<div class="section-example-container" id="testable">
    <pre class="csharp">public class CustomBrokerageMessageHandlerAlgorithm : QCAlgorithm

        SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.InteractiveBrokersBrokerage, AccountType.Margin);
        // Set the brokerage message handler to our custom model.
        SetBrokerageMessageHandler(new CustomBrokerageMessageHandler(this));

        // Request SPY data for trading.
        _spy = AddEquity("SPY").Symbol;
    }

    public override void OnData(Slice slice)
    {
        // Buy and hold SPY as a strategy.
        if (!Portfolio.Invested)
        {
