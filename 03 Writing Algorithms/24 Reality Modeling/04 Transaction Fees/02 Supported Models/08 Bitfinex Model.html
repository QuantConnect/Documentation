<p>The <code>BitfinexFeeModel</code> models the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.bitfinex.com/fees/">Bitfinex live trading fees</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>BitfinexFeeModel</code> charges a 0.1% maker fee and a 0.2% taker fee. If you place a limit order that hits a hidden order or you add liquidity to the order book by placing a limit order that doesn't cross the spread, you pay maker fees. If you place a hidden order or you remove liquidity from the order book by placing an order that crosses the spread, you pay taker fees. Bitfinex adjusts your fees based on your 30-day trading volume and LEO balance, but we don't currently model these metrics to adjust fees.</p>

<p>The <code>BitfinexFeeModel</code> charges fees in the currency you receive from a trade. For example, if you buy ETHBTC, you pay fees in ETH. If you sell ETHBTC, you pay fees in BTC.</p>
