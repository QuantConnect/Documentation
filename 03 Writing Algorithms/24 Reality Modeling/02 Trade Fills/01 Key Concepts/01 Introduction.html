<p>A trade fill is the quantity and price at which your brokerage executes your order in the market. Fill models model how each type of order fills to accurately simulate the behavior of a real brokerage. Fill models don't use data with the order timestamp to avoid look-ahead bias. If your algorithm subscribes to minute-resolution data and places a market order at 10:00 am, it will fill at 10:01 am.</p>

<p>Fill models determine the price and quantity of your fills, can incorporate spread costs, and work with the slippage model to add slippage into the fill price. If you trade US Equities, our built-in fill models can fill your orders at the official opening and closing auction prices.</p>
