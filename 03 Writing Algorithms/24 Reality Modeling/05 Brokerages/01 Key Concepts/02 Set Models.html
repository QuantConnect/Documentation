<p>To set a brokerage model, in the <code>Initialize</code> method, call the <code>SetBrokerageModel</code> method with a <code>BrokerageName</code> and an <code>AccountType</code>. If you set a brokerage model, it overrides any security level models you manually set in your algorithm.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.OandaBrokerage); // Defaults to margin account
SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.Bitfinex, AccountType.Margin); // Overrides the default account type
</pre>
<pre class="python">self.set_brokerage_model(BrokerageName.OANDABROKERAGE) # Defaults to margin account
self.set_brokerage_model(BrokerageName.BITFINEX, AccountType.MARGIN) # Overrides the default account type
</pre></div>

<p>In live trading, LEAN doesn't ignore your <code>SetBrokerageModel</code> method calls. LEAN uses some of the brokerage model rules to catch invalid orders before they reach your real brokerage.</p>
