<p class="csharp">You can only add properties to the <code>Security</code> type.</p>

<p class="python">
    You can add properties to all types. However, these properties live in the Python space, so you can't access them without a reference. 
    The following example demonstrates that you can add an <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/supported-indicators/exponential-moving-average'>exponential moving average</a> to the <code>symbol</code> attribute of a <code>Security</code> object.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container python">
    <pre class="python"># Custom properties can be added to Python objects, but can't be accessed without a reference to the object.
equity = self.add_equity("SPY")
self._symbol = equity.symbol
self._symbol.ema = self.ema(self._symbol, 10)
ema = self._symbol.ema.current.value

ema = self.securities["SPY"].symbol.ema.current.value   # 'Symbol' object has no attribute 'time'</pre>
</div>
