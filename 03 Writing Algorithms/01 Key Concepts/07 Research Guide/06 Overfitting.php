<p>If you have a collection of factors, you can backtest over a period of time to find the best-performing factors for the time period. If you then narrow the collection of factors to just the best-performing ones and backtest over the same period, the backtest will show great results. However, if you take the same best-performing factors and backtest them on an out-of-sample dataset, the performance will almost always underperform the in-sample period. To avoid issues with overfitting, follow these guidelines:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use walk-forward optimization to train your models on historical data and test them on future data.</li>
    <li>Test your strategy with live paper trading.</li>
    <li>Test your model on different asset classes and markets.</li>
</ul>
