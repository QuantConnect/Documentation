<p>Exchanges are located in different areas, so they can have different time zones. To get the time zone of the exchange that a <code>Security</code> trades on, use its <code>Exchange.Hours.TimeZone</code> property.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">var timeZone = Securities[_symbol].Exchange.Hours.TimeZone;</pre>
<pre class="python">time_zone = self.securities[self.symbol].exchange.hours.time_zone</pre>
</div>
