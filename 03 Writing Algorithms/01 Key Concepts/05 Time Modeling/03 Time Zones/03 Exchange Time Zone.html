<p>Exchanges are located in different areas, so they can have different time zones. LEAN tracks the time zone of each exchange so that you receive the correct data at the right point in time in your algorithm. If you have multiple exchanges in your algorithm from different time zones, LEAN synchronizes them to your algorithm time. Furthermore, if you set up <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/consolidating-data/consolidator-types/time-period-consolidators'>time period consolidators</a>, LEAN consolidates the data based on the data time zone.</p>
    
<p>To get the time zone of the exchange that a <code>Security</code> trades on, use its <code class="csharp">Exchange.Hours.TimeZone</code><code class="python">exchange.hours.time_zone</code> property.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Get the time zone of the exchange for a specific asset.
var timeZone = Securities[_symbol].Exchange.Hours.TimeZone;</pre>
<pre class="python"># Get the time zone of the exchange for a specific asset.
time_zone = self.securities[self._symbol].exchange.hours.time_zone</pre>
</div>
