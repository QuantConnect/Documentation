<p>Datasets can have different time zones because the time zone is up to the data provider, where they are located, and where they collect the data. LEAN converts their time zones to their <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/key-concepts/time-modeling/time-zones#03-Exchange-Time-Zone'>exchange time zone</a> and synchronizes them to your algorithm time.</p>

<p>To get the time zone of a dataset, view the listing page in the <a href="/datasets">Dataset Market</a> or call the <code>GetDataTimeZone</code> method.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python"># Get the time zone of an asset.
time_zone = self.market_hours_database.get_data_time_zone(Market.USA, self._symbol, SecurityType.EQUITY)</pre>
<pre class="csharp">// Get the time zone of an asset.
var timeZone = MarketHoursDatabase.GetDataTimeZone(Market.USA, _symbol, SecurityType.Equity);</pre>
