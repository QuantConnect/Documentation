<p>Datasets can have different time zones because the time zone is up to the data provider, where they are located, and where they collect the data. LEAN tracks the time zone of each dataset so that you receive the correct data at the right point in time in your algorithm. If you have multiple datasets in your algorithm from different time zones, LEAN synchronizes them to your algorithm time. Furthermore, if you set up <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/consolidating-data/consolidator-types/time-period-consolidators'>time period consolidators</a>, LEAN consolidates the data based on the data time zone.</p>

<p>To get the time zone of a dataset, view the listing page in the <a href="/datasets">Dataset Market</a> or call the <code>GetDataTimeZone</code> method.</p>
