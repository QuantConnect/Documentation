<p>The following examples demonstrate some common practices for period time modeling.</p>
<h4>Example 1: Tick Signals & Daily Bars</h4>
<p>
 This example shows using a tick/pointwise signal from the <a href="/datasets/smart-insider-corporate-buybacks">Smart Insider Intention</a> dataset while trading Starbuck's stock with daily bars. 
 To liquidate the position after two trading days, you can count the number of <code>TradeBar</code> objects you get in the <code class='csharp'>OnData</code><code class='python'>on_data</code> method.
