<p>
 The following examples demonstrate some common practices for period time modeling.

<h4>
 Example 1: Tick Signal Daily Security Bar
</h4>
<p>
 This example shows using a tick/pointwise signal from
 <a href="/datasets/smart-insider-corporate-buybacks">
  Smart Insider Intention
 </a>
 dataset to buy AAPL in daily resolution. You can count down the holding trade days per each AAPL trade bar received to liquidate the position after 2 trading days.
