<p>Point values have no period because they occur at a singular point in time. Examples of point data includes ticks, open interest, and news releases. Tick data represents a single trade or quote in the market. It's a discrete event with no period, so the <code>Time</code> and <code>EndTime</code> properties are the same. LEAN emits ticks as soon as they arrive and doesn't fill them forward.</p>
