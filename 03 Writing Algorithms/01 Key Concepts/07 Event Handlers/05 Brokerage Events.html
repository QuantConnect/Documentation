<p>The <code>OnBrokerageDisconnect</code> and <code>OnBrokerageReconnect</code> event handlers pass information to the algorithm about the brokerage connection status. This can be helpful for considering when to place a trade when a brokerage API is unreliable or under maintenance. The <code>OnBrokerageMessage</code> event handler provides information from the brokerages, including the disconnect and reconnect messages. Message content varies with each brokerage.</p>
<p>Brokerage events are triggered asynchronously in live trading, and are not created in backtesting.</p>
