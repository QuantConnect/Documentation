<p>The <code class="csharp">OnMarginCallWarning</code><code class="python">on_margin_call_warning</code> and <code class="csharp">OnMarginCall</code><code class="python">on_margin_call</code> event handlers provide information and control over how to reduce algorithm leverage when performance is poor. </p>

<p>The <code class="csharp">OnMarginCallWarning</code><code class="python">on_margin_call_warning</code> method is called when there is less than 5% margin remaining to give you an opportunity to reduce leverage before an official margin call is performed by the brokerage. The <code class="csharp">OnMarginCall</code><code class="python">on_margin_call</code> event handler is passed a list of <code>SubmitOrderRequest</code> objects which will be executed on exiting the method.</p>

<p>Margin events are called before the data events are processed. </p>
