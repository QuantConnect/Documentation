<p>
  Algorithms can record string messages ('log statements') to a file for analysis after a backtest is complete, or as a live algorithm is running. 
  These records can assist in debugging logical flow errors in the project code or recording key decision moments.
  Backtests can process millions of data points. 
  If you place a log statement in the wrong place, it can generate gigabytes of logs, which can be difficult to sift through.
  When you add to the log file, ensure they are readable.

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">// Logging records string messages to a file to debug errors or record key decisions.
Log($"Signal triggered. Placing limit order: {limit}");</pre>
    <pre class="python"># Logging records string messages to a file to debug errors or record key decisions.
self.log(f"Signal triggered. Placing limit order: {limit}")</pre>
</div>

<p>Debug statements are the same as log statements, but <code class="csharp">Debug</code><code class="python">debug</code> method statements are orange in the Cloud Terminal to provide more emphasis.
Debug statements are streamed to the Cloud Terminal while the backtest is running. This can be helpful for real-time updates or monitoring in live-trading.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">// Debugging streams messages to the Cloud Terminal for real-time analysis.
Debug($"Exposure to the {sectorName} sector is above 50%!");</pre>
    <pre class="python"># Debugging streams messages to the Cloud Terminal for real-time analysis.
self.debug("Exposure to the {sector_name} sector is above 50%!")</pre>
