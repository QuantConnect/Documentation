<p>
  Algorithms can record string messages ('log statements') to a file for analysis after a backtest is complete, or as a live algorithm is running. 
  These records can assist in debugging logical flow errors in the project code or recording key decision moments.
  Backtests can process millions of data points. 
  If you place a log statement in the wrong place, it can generate gigabytes of logs, which can be difficult to sift through.
  When you add to the log file, ensure they are readable.

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">// record string messages to a file to debug logical flow errors or record key decisions
    Log($"Signal triggered. Placing limit order: {limit}");</pre>
    <pre class="python"># record string messages to a file to debug logical flow errors or record key decisions
      self.log(f"Signal triggered. Placing limit order: {limit}")</pre>
</div>

<p>Debug statements are the same as log statements, but <code class="csharp">Debug</code><code class="python">debug</code> method statements are orange in the Cloud Terminal to provide more emphasis.
Debug statements are streamed to the Cloud Terminal while the backtest is running. This can be helpful for real-time updates or monitoring in live-trading.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">// record string messages streamed to the Cloud Terminal for real time updates
    Debug($"Exposure to the {sectorName} sector is above 50%!");</pre>
    <pre class="python"># record string messages streamed to the Cloud Terminal for real time updates
    self.debug("Exposure to the {sector_name} sector is above 50%!")</pre>
</div>
