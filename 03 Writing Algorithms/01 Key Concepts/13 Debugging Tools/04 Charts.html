  Plotting values over time can help you understand its range, identify outliers in data, and see times when your algorithm generates unusual values.
  Before you create a plot, develop a theory about what you expect to see before you view it to gain a deeper understanding of your algorithm.
  For example, a plot of an asset's price standard deviations should be between -4 and +4, with any outliers happening during extreme market conditions like the COVID pandemic in March 2020.
  LEAN provides a powerful charting API.
  You can create time series plots with just a single line of code.

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">// Create time series plots to understand range and identify outliers.
    Plot("Deviations", "aapl", assetDeviation);</pre>
    <pre class="python"># Create time series plots to understand range and identify outliers.
    self.plot("Deviations", "aapl", asset_deviation)</pre>
</div>
