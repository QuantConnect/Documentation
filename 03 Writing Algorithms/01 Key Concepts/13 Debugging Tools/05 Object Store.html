<p>
  The Object Store is a key-value data store for low-latency information storage and retrieval.
  During a backtest, you can build large objects youâ€™d like to analyze and write them for later analysis. 
  This workflow can be helpful when the objects are large and plotting is impossible or when you want to perform analysis across many backtests.
