<p>After you train a model, you can save it into the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/object-store">Object Store</a>. In QuantConnect Cloud, we back up your Object Store data on QuantConnect servers. In local algorithms, your local machine saves the Object Store data. If you save models in live algorithms, save them at the end of the training method so you can access the trained model again if your algorithm stops executing. If you save models in backtests, save them during the <code>OnEndOfAlgorithm</code> event handler so that saving multiple times doesn't slow down your backtest.</p>
