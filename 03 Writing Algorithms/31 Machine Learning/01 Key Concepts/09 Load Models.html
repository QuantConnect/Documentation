<p>You can load machine learning models from the Object Store or a custom data file like pickle. If you load models from the Object Store, before you load the model into your algorithm, in the <code>Initialize</code> method, check if the Object Store already contains the model. To avoid <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/key-concepts/glossary#17-look-ahead-bias'>look-ahead bias</a> in backtests, don't train your model on the same data you use to test the model.</p>
