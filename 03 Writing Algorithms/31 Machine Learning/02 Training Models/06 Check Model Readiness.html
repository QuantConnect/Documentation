<p>In backtests, the <code class="csharp">Train</code><code class="python">train</code> method is synchronous, so it blocks your algorithm execution while the model trains. In live trading, the <code class="csharp">Train</code><code class="python">train</code> method is asynchronous, so ensure your model is trained before you continue the algorithm execution. Training occurs on a separate thread, so set a boolean flag to notify your algorithm of the model state. A <span class="new-term">semaphore</span> is a thread-safe flag you can use to synchronize program operations across different threads. <br></p>
