<p>You can schedule model training sessions in a similar way to a Scheduled Event. To schedule a training session do this, pass in a <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/scheduled-events#04-Date-Rules'>DateRules</a> and <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/scheduled-events#05-Time-Rules'>TimeRules</a> argument to the <code>Train</code> method.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Set TrainingMethod to be executed at 8:00 am every Sunday
Train(DateRules.Every(DayOfWeek.Sunday), TimeRules.At(8, 0), MyTrainingMethod);</pre>
<pre class="python"># Set TrainingMethod to be executed at 8:00 am every Sunday
self.train(self.date_rules.every(DayOfWeek.sunday), self.time_rules.at(8,0), self.my_training_method)</pre> 
</div>

<p>We recommend you schedule your training sessions for when the market is closed to get the best compute allocation. While the market is open, your CPU is occupied with processing incoming tick data and handling other LEAN events.</p>
