<p>To train models immediately, call the <code class="csharp">Train</code><code class="python">train</code> method and pass in the name of your training method.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp"># Schedule machine learning model training to bypass method call timeouts for longer training sessions.
Train(MyTrainingMethod);</pre>
<pre class="python">// Schedule machine learning model training to bypass method call timeouts for longer training sessions.
self.train(self.my_method)</pre> 
</div>

<p>Immediate training is most useful for training your model when you first deploy your strategy to production or when the model's performance begins to degrade.</p>
