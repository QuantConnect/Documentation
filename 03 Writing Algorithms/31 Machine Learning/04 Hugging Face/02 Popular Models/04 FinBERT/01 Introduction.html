  FinBERT is a pre-trained NLP model to analyze sentiment of financial text. 
  It is built by further training the BERT language model in the finance domain, using a large financial corpus and thereby fine-tuning it for financial sentiment classification.

  For more details, please see the paper <a rel="nofollow" target='_blank' href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10063">FinBERT: Financial Sentiment Analysis with Pre-trained Language Models</a> and our related <a rel="nofollow" target='_blank' href="https://medium.com/prosus-ai-tech-blog/finbert-financial-sentiment-analysis-with-bert-b277a3607101">blog post</a> on Medium.

<p>The model will give softmax outputs for three labels: positive, negative or neutral.</p>
