<p>The FinBERT model is a sentiment analysis model. The following use cases explain how you might utilize it in trading algorithms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Analyze the sentiment of the latest <a href='/datasets/tiingo-news-feed'>news articles for specific companies</a>, then form a long-short portfolio with assets that have the most postive and most negative news sentiment.</li>
  <li>Monitor the sentiment of <a href='/datasets/regalytics-us-regulatory-alerts'>regulatory alerts</a> in a <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/risk-management/key-concepts'>risk management model</a> and liquidate holdings when sentiment is extremely negative.</li>
  <li>Generate sentences based on information from other <a href='/datasets/'>datasets</a> and then feed them into the model to determine the sentiment. For example, you could use the <a href='/datasets/quiver-quantitative-us-government-contracts'>US Government Contracts</a> dataset to create the string "The Department of State grants AAPL a contract for the purchase of mobile phones".</li>
</ul>
