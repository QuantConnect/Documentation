<p>This page explains how to use Chronos-T5 in LEAN trading algorithms. The following description comes from the <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='https://huggingface.co/amazon/chronos-t5-tiny'>model repository</a>:</p>

  Chronos is a family of <strong>pretrained time series forecasting models</strong> based on language model architectures. 
  A time series is transformed into a sequence of tokens via scaling and quantization, and a language model is trained on these tokens using the cross-entropy loss. 
  Once trained, probabilistic forecasts are obtained by sampling multiple future trajectories given the historical context. 
  Chronos models have been trained on a large corpus of publicly available time series data, as well as synthetic data generated using Gaussian processes.
