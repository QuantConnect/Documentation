<p>
 The following examples demonstrate some common practices for using
 <code>
  Hmmlearn
 </code>
 library.
</p>
<h4>
 Example 1: Hidden Markov Model Regime Detection
</h4>
<p>
 The below algorithm makes use of
 <code>
  Hmmlearn
 </code>
 library to predict the future market regime through a hidden markov model using return data. If the regime is upward market, we hold SPY. Otherwise, we liquidate the portfolio. The model is trained using rolling 2-year data. To ensure the model applicable to the current market environment, we recalibrate the model on every Sunday.
