<p>
 The following examples demonstrate some common practices for using
 <code>
  Tslearn
 </code>
 library.
</p>
<h4>
 Example 1: Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW) Clustering
</h4>
<p>
 The below algorithm makes use of
 <code>
  Tslearn
 </code>
 library to cluster stocks based on their recent year's price movement through DTW Barycenter Averaging. Then, we invest each cluster equally, while investing stocks within cluster equally as well. To ensure the model applicable to the current market environment, we recalibrate the model on every Sunday.
