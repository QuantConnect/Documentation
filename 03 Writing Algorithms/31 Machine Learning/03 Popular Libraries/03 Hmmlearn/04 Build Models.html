<p>In this example, assume the market has only 2 regimes and the market returns follow a Gaussian distribution. Therefore, create a 2-component Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian emissions, which is equivalent to a Gaussian mixture model with 2 means.</p>
<p>To build the model, call the <code>GaussianHMM</code> constructor with the number of components, a covariance type, and the number of iterations:</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python"># Initialize GaussianHMM with the number of components, covariance type, and iteration count.
self.model = hmm.GaussianHMM(n_components=2, covariance_type="full", n_iter=100)</pre>
