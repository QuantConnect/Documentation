<p>
    The organization workspace directory initially has following structure:
</p>

<? include(DOCS_RESOURCES."/cli/init/structure.php"); ?>

<p>As you add <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/projects/getting-started'>projects</a>, the project files are added to your organization workspace directory. If you create and use <a href='/docs/v2/local-platform/projects/shared-libraries'>shared libraries</a> in your projects, the library files are added to a <span class='public-directory-name'>Library</span> directory in your organization workspace.</p>
