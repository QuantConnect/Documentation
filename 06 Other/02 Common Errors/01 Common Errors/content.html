		 Runtime Error: 'AAPL' wasn't found in the TradeBars object
	</h4>
	<p>
		    You're attempting to access data which is not in the TradeBars dictionary. There are two key reasons for this: 
		<br/>
			    1. You have not requested data for this security in the Initialize method.
			<br/>
				    2. The data has gaps because it is not filling forward, or you're accessing the data after-hours when there won't be any price information.
			</p>

			<h4>
				Backtest Error: Error initializing algorithm: Date Invalid
			</h4>
			<p>
				    You may have accidentally put invalid start and end dates into your algorithm. Or potentially you pressed backtest before the algorithm was fully saved.    Please Ctrl+S to save the document, wait for its confirmation, and then click Backtest again.
