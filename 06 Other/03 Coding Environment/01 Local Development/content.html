	    We recommend using <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/" target="_BLANK">Visual Studio 
				    Community Edition</a> as your programming environment. The community edition has the full power of Visual Studio and enables programming    in C#, F#, VB and Python. If you're running on Mac or Linux you can also use <a href="http://www.monodevelop.com/download/" target="_BLANK">MonoDevelop</a> or     <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/" target="_BLANK">Xamarin Studio</a>.

	    If you prefer coding locally, you can run LEAN inside Visual Studio. The LEAN installation takes about 5 minutes and allows you to backtest locally and copy-paste    your algorithms into QuantConnect.com. Check out the <a href="https://lean.quantconnect.com/docs#topic14.html" target="_BLANK">LEAN-Getting
				    Started Tutorial</a> for more information.
