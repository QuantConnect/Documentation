<p>
QuantConnect provides survivorship bias free, split and dividend adjusted US Equities data from January 1st, 1998 to today data on all US stocks. Over this period a number of new stocks have entered the market, and others have been delisted. When a company name/symbol changes the data will be automatically be mapped over to the original name. By default data is adjusted for <a href="#equity/usa/splits">splits</a> and <a href="#equity/usa/dividends">dividends</a>.
</p>
<p>All data is available in tick, second, minute, hourly and daily resolution. Tick data is provided in order the trades were made, but the data itself is time stamped to the previous second.</p>
<p>The Tick data is raw and unfiltered - which includes suspicious, untradable and off market ticks. This can often result in unrealistic backtests. Before using tick data you should fully understand all the exchange codes and the "suspicious" flag which indicates a tick you should ignore. Unless you're an expert you should use the pre-filtered second and minute data.</p>
