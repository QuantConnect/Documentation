QuantConnect supports cryptocurrency backtesting and live trading. We launched 2017 with the GDAX exchange.

<p>Cryptocurrency trading is handled similarly to a forex transaction; however the exchanges do not provide the same holdings history as traditional forex brokerages so it has some unique challenges in live trading we will go into below. Cryptocurrency is also sensitive to transaction fees so it is important to set the correct BrokerageModel.</p>
<p>One common stumbling block that users face designing algorithms with crypto currency is a misunderstanding of Cash modeling. Most crypto exchanges only support cash trading so you cannot place trades when you do not have the cash in your account. 'Cash' in this sense means any of the crypto coin types. </p>
<p>For example, if you have $100,000 USD; but no LTC in your portfolio - you cannot trade BTCLTC, and in order to trade BTCEUR you need EUR in your portfolio. This means you must make trading decisions based on the <code>Cashbook</code>. This holds your current balance of coins available.
</p>
<p>We recommend setting the BrokerageModel to help force your backtesting to behave as close as possible to the production live trading environment.</p>
