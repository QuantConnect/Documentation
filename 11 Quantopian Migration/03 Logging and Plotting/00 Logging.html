<p>
    In QuantConnect, the <code>self.Debug()</code> method is the equivalent of the <code>log.info()</code> function in Quantopian.
    Debug output is viewable via the QuantConnect Terminal Console.
</p>
<p>
    Output to the console via <code>self.Debug()</code> is rate-limited. 
    If you need long-term storage of your logs and don't want to overflow the console, 
    consider using <code>self.Log()</code> instead.

    An example comparing logging between Quantopian and QuantConnect is shown below.
</p>
<p>
    Quantopian
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python">def initialize(context):
    log.info("Hello, console!")</pre>
</div>
<p>
    QuantConnect
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="python">class MyLoggingAlgorithm(QCAlgorithm):
    def Initialize(self):
        self.Debug("Hello, console!")
        self.Log("Hello, backtesting logs!")</pre>
</div>
<p>
    Logging via <code>self.Log()</code> has daily limits in QuantConnect. 
    On the free tier, users are limited to 10KB of logs per day for your account/organization. 
    To increase this limit, you can upgrade your account to a different tier. Calls to <code>self.Debug()</code>
    will also count towards the 10KB log limit, but are always outputted to the Terminal Console regardless of
    your daily log limit.

    You can view the logs generated via <code>self.Log()</code> for a backtest
    by first accessing a backtest, and clicking the "Logs" tab near the bottom of the page.
    To download the logs, you can click the "Download Logs" link to download a text file containing
    your backtest's logs.
