    From the beginning, LEAN has strived to use an open, human-readable data format - independent of any specific database or file format. From this core philosophy, we built LEAN to read its financial data from flat files on disk. Data compression is done in zip format, and all individual files are CSV or JSON.

    The prices are expressed in the asset <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/key-concepts#06-Quote-Currency">quote currency</a>. For example, the value 0.06920 for ETHBTC is the amount of BTC, the quote currency, you need to buy 1 ETH.

    When there is no activity for a security, the price is omitted from the file. Only new ticks and price changes are recorded.
