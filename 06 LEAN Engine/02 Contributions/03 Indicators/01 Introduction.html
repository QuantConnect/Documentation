  LEAN currently supports over 100 <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/supported-indicators'>indicators</a>.
  This page explains how to contribute a new indicator to the open-source project by making a pull request to Lean. 
  Before you get started, familiarize yourself with our <a href='https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>contributing guidelines</a>, and review <a href='https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/pull/8454' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>previous contributions</a> to understand our standards. 
  If you don't already have a new indicator in mind that you want to contribute, see <a href='https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aindicator' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>the GitHub Issues in the Lean repository</a> for a list of indicators that community members have requested. Before you begin, create a GitHub Issue with a description of your proposed indicator, links to relevant resources, and source of <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/lean-engine/contributions/indicators'>third-party values</a>.
