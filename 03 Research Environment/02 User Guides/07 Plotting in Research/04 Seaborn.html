Seaborn is a data visualization library based on matplotlib. It makes it easier to create more complicated plots. It also allows us to create much more visually appealing charts than offered by matplotlib.

<h4> Example 1: Heatmap Chart</h4>

<p>
It is a well-known phenomenon that the price of stocks in the same sector may sometimes be correlated over periods of time. A good example of this is Coca-Cola and Pepsi, which not only operate in the same industry but also sell similar products. We can determine if two stocks are correlated over a period of time by calculating the correlation coefficient of their prices. Let's examine a set of stocks in the banking industry and check whether any pair of stocks are correlated.

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">import seaborn as sns

qb = QuantBook()

tickers = [
    "BAC", # Bank of America Corporation
    "COF", # Capital One Financial Corporation
    "C",   # Citigroup Inc.
    "JPM", # J P Morgan Chase &amp; Co
    "STI", # SunTrust Banks, Inc.
    "WFC", # Wells Fargo &amp; Company
]
symbols = [qb.AddEquity(ticker, Resolution.Daily).Symbol for ticker in tickers]</pre>
</div>

<p>Let's make a history call for the close values over a period of a few months for our banking stocks. Then we can use the pandas method <code>dataframe.corr()</code> to calculate the correlation matrix.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">history = qb.History(symbols, 
                     datetime(2020, 2, 1), 
                     datetime(2020, 7, 1), 
                     Resolution.Daily).close.unstack(level=0)

correlation_matrix = history.corr()</pre>
</div>

<p>Then using seaborn we can chart our correlation matrix as a heatmap, revealing to us which stocks were correlated over that period of time. Correlation values close to 1 correspond to closely correlated stocks.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix)</pre>
</div>
