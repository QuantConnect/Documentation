Data comes in two different "shapes" according to the time period it covers: point values, or period values. These have different properties in LEAN which determine when the data is emitted to your algorithm. The coordination of emitting this data is controlled by the <i>Time Frontier</i>.
In QuantConnect, Ticks are point values, and Bars have a period.</p>

<h4>The Time Frontier</h4>
<p>
QuantConnect allows your algorithm to request data for multiple securities and multiple resolutions. This creates a situation where one of your data subscriptions is ready to emit, but another subscription with a longer period may still be constructing its bar. To coordinate this data we use the <i>End Time</i> of a data point to transmit it to your algorithm.
</p>

<p>
Once a datapoint's <i>EndTime</i> has passed, it will be transmitted to your algorithm OnData() method. For bar data, this is the beginning of the <i>next</i> bar. Your algorithm is only permitted to access values of securities from before this Time Frontier, preventing you from accidentally looking into the future.
</p>

<p>The <code class="csharp">Time</code><code class="python">self.Time</code> property in your algorithm is always equal to this Time Frontier. This is also used as the timestamp for any <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/algorithm-reference/logging-and-debug">logging and debugging</a> messages.</p>


<h4>Bar Data - Period Values</h4>
<p>
Bar data represents the aggregation of a period of data into a single object. In QuantConnect, we make this easy for you by pre-aggregating billions of raw trade-ticks into <i>Trade Bars</i>, and quote-ticks into <i>Quote Bars</i>.</p>
<p>
The close of a bar is not known until the start of the <i>next</i> bar, which can sometimes be confusing. For example, a price bar for Friday will include all the ticks from Friday 00:00 to Friday 23:59.99999, but it will actually be emitted to your algorithm on Saturday at midnight. Because of this, any orders you create after analyzing the Friday data will be sent to your brokerage on Saturday, when most markets are closed. QuantConnect automatically turns your order into a <code>MarketOnOpen</code> order, which will be filled Monday morning.

<p>
When there are no ticks during a period, the previous bar transmitted is copied and emitted at the request resolution. In QuantConnect, this is the default behavior for bar data and it is referred to as "filling the data forward". You can configure whether this is enabled when you <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/algorithm-reference/initializing-algorithms#Initializing-Algorithms-Selecting-Asset-Data">request the security data</a>.
</p>

<p>
QuantConnect provides data in Second, Minute, Hour, and Daily bar format. To create other periods of bars, you need to <a href="/docs/algorithm-reference/consolidating-data" class="docs-internal-link">consolidate</a> these short periods into larger ones.
</p>

<h4>Tick Data - Point Values</h4>
<p>
Tick data represents a single trade or quote made on the market. It is a discrete event that does not have a period of time attached to it. These events are emitted as soon as they arrive to LEAN. 
</p>

<p>
$[Tick, T:QuantConnect.Data.Market.Tick] objects have the same value of Time and EndTime because they have no <i>period</i>. They represent instantaneous point values and cannot be filled forward.
