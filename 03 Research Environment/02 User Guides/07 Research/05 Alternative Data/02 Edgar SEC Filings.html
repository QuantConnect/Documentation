<p>
Publicly traded companies in the US must file important investor notices (8-K) quarterly reports (10-Q), yearly reports (10-K), and any other publicly available reports to the SEC. These filings contain important information about a company's finances, including their income statements and balance sheets. 
</p>

<p>
The report contents are not parsed in any way. The contents range from plain text to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBRL
">XBRL</a> structured data format. For more information about the SEC and structured data formats, please visit the SEC's <a href="https://www.sec.gov/structureddata">Office of Structured Disclosure</a> webpage.
</p>

<h4> Making History Calls </h4>

<p>
SEC filing data is a linked data source. This means filing data is tied to the underlying equity whenever possible. This linkage is performed by the ticker used at the time of the filing. To add the right data to your strategy, you should use the equity symbol when you request SEC data.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># We must import any custom data that we want to use
from QuantConnect.Data.Custom.SEC import *



# Request underlying equity data.
aapl = qb.AddEquity("AAPL")

# Add SEC 10-Q (quarterly report) filings for Apple
aapl_10Q = qb.AddData(SECReport10Q, aapl)

# Add SEC 10-K (yearly report) filings for Apple
aapl_10K = qb.AddData(SECReport10K, aapl)

# Add SEC 8-K (investor notices) filings for Apple
aapl_8K = qb.AddData(SECReport8K, aapl)

</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can then make requests for <i>AAPL</i>'s historical  price data and report data using <code>qb.History</code>.  History calls for alternative data sources are similar to history calls for price data. We can use either <code>qb.History(Type, Symbol, StartDate, EndDate)</code>, where Type is the data type, Symbol is the symbol for which to retrieve data for, or we can use <code>qb.History(Type, Symbol, Period)</code>, which returns historical data from the given past period starting from today's date.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># We request for 1000 days of data starting from today
aapl_history = self.History(aapl.Symbol, timedelta(days=1000), Resolution.Daily)

report_history = self.History(SECReport8K, aapl_8K.Symbol, timedelta(days=1000))
</pre>
</div>


<h4>Accessing and Manipulating Data</h4>

<p>
We can then analyze this data by plotting it. Let's analyze the performance of AAPL in the days after an 8-K report is released. Let's first plot the daily close values of AAPL.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># Format our chart
plt.title(f'Stock price {n} days after 8-K report released (AAPL)')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')


# Access the close column
aapl_daily_close = aapl_history_daily['close']

# Foward fill missing data points and plot it as a transparant(alpha=0.2) line graph.
aapl_daily_close.fillna(method='ffill').plot(alpha=0.2)
</pre>
</div>

<figcaption>AAPL Historical Daily Close</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Then let's highlight the daily historical closes after an 8-K release by replotting those close values on top of the previous plot.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># For every date that an 8-K is released
for date in report_history.index.levels[1]:
    start_time = date
    end_time = date + timedelta(days=20)
    aapl_history_daily.loc[start_time:end_time]['close'].plot() # Plot the historical close values 20 days after 
</pre>
</div>
