For example, indicators like the RSI tell you, based on price and volume data, if the market is overbought or oversold. Because indicators can extract overall market trends from price data, sometimes, you may want to look for correlations between indicators and the market, instead of between raw price data and the market. To view all of the indicators and candlestick patterns we provide, see the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/indicator-reference'>Indicator Reference</a>.</p>",
