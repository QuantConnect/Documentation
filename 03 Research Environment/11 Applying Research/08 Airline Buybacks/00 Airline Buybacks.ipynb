    "\n",
    "### Create Hypothesis\n",
    "Buyback represents a company buy back its own stocks in the market, as (1) management is confident on its own future, and (2) wants more control over its development. Since usually buyback is in large scale on a schedule, the price of repurchasing often causes price fluctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airlines is one of the largest buyback sectors. Major US Airlines use over 90% of their free cashflow to buy back their own stocks in the recent years.<sup><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-16/u-s-airlines-spent-96-of-free-cash-flow-on-buybacks-chart\">[1]</a></sup> Therefore, we can use airline companies to test the hypothesis of buybacks would cause price action. In this particular exmaple, we're hypothesizing that difference in buyback price and close price would suggest price change in certain direction. (we don't know forward return would be in momentum or mean-reversion in this case!)\n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "We'll need to use the <a href=\"https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets/smart-insider-corporate-buybacks/pricing/\">Smart Insider Corporate Buybacks Transaction</a> dataset in this tutorial, you must subscribe to this dataset to get this data.\n",

    "If you use Python, you must understand how to work with pandas DataFrames and Series. If you are not familiar with pandas, refer to the <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/\">pandas documentation</a>."
