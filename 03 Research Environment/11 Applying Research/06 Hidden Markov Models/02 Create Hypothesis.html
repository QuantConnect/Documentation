<p>A Markov process is a stochastic process where the possibility of switching to another state depends only on the current state of the model by the current state's probability distribution (it is usually represented by a state transition matrix). It is history-independent, or memoryless. While often a Markov process's state is observable, the states of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is not observable. This means the input(s) and output(s) are observable, but their intermediate, the state, is non-observable/hidden.</p>

<p>In finance, HMM is particularly useful in determining the market regime, usually classified into "Bull" and "Bear" markets. Another popular classification is "Volatile" vs "Involatile" market, such that we can avoid entering the market when it is too risky. We hypothesis a HMM could be able to do the later, so we can produce a SPY-out-performing portfolio (positive alpha).</p>
