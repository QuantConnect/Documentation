Jupyter notebooks were created with the intention to support interactive data science and scientific computing across various programming languages. QuantConnect carries on that philosophy by providing an environment for you to perform exploratory research and brainstorm new ideas for algorithms.  A jupyter notebook installed in QuantConnect allows you to directly explore the massive amounts of data that are available in QuantConnect and analyze it with python or C# CLI commands. We call this exploratory notebook environment the Research environment.

The backtesting environment is an event-based simulation of the market. And although backtests aim to provide an accurate representation of whether a strategy would have performed well in the past, backtests are generally slow and are not the most efficient way to test the foundational ideas behind strategies. Backtests should only be used to verify an idea whose merit has already been tested through statistical analysis.

The research environment allows you to build a strategy by starting with a central hypothesis about the market. For example, we might hypothesize that an increase in sunshine-hours will increase the production of oranges, which will lead to an increase in the supply of oranges, thus decreasing the price of Orange Juice Futures. This is a working hypothesis which we can first attempt to confirm by analyzing weather data, production of oranges data, and price of Orange Juice futures. If our hypothesis is confirmed with a degree of statistical significance, we can be confident in our hypothesis and then translate that analysis into a backtestable strategy.
