	Scheduled events allow you to trigger code to run at specific times of day. This happens regardless of your data events. The schedule API requires a date and time rule to specify when the event is fired.

	Scheduled events need a $[DateRules C] and $[TimeRules] pair to set a specific time. When the event is triggered the action block is executed.
