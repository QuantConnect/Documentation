	Historical data can be provided in a batch request, or by "warming up" your algorithm. Batch requests feed requested data back as an enumerable you can use to manually prime your algorithm. The warm up feature feeds data to your event handlers from before your start date for a fixed period.

	In live mode the history API can return data up to 5 seconds before the present moment.
