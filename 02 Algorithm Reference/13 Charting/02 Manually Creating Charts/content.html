	In your initialize method you can use the <code>AddChart(Chart obj)</code> method to insert a new chart. Each chart object has an internal collection of Series objects.
</p>
<p>
	In creating Series objects you must specify the name of the series, the $[SeriesType] and the <i>index</i> the series operates on. The series index refers to its position in the chart - for example; if all the series are index 0, they will lay on top of each other. If each series has its own index, it will be have several mini-charts stack next to each other.

	The picture below shows an EMA cross chart with both EMA series set to the same index:

	Using different indexes the chart looks as follows:
