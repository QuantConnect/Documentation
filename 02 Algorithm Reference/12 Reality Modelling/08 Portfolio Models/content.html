	Portfolio models control how order fills are applied to your portfolio. They take an $[OrderEvent], $[Security] and $[SecurityPortfolioManager] object and update the holdings to reflect the new final position. You should only need to update your portfolio model when you are create a new asset type.

	Portfolio models implement the $[ISecurityPortfolioModel] interface.
