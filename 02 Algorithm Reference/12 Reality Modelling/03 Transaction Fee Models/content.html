	Transaction fee models set the fees for each order. We provide customized transaction models for all brokerages, but you can also set your own. Like all models they must be set on a security by security basis.

	Transaction models implement the $[ISecurityTransactionModel] interface. If you wish to implement your own transaction model you can start with the $[SecurityTransactionModel] and override methods you wish to change.
