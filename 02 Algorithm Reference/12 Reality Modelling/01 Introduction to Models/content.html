	Models can be used to improve the accuracy of your backtesting. We provide basic default models which assume you are trading on highly liquid assets, but if you are trading high volumes, or on low volume assets you should update these models to be more realistic.

<p>
	All models are set on a per security basis. To set a model first fetch the security object and apply your model. <pre>//Set IBM to have a constant $1 transaction fee. 
Securities["IBM"].FeeModel = new ConstantFeeTransactionModel(1); </pre>
</p>
<p>
	All models should be setup in your Initialize() method.
