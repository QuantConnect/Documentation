	We provide a shortcut to set common models and properties relating to each of the brokerages we support. These brokerage models set fees, fill models, slippage models and trading markets for a brokerage. In addition they validate it is possible to submit trades to the brokerage (e.g. submitting equity trades to a forex only brokerage).
	<ul>
		<li>
			Transaction fees models
		</li>
		<li>
			Supported markets
		</li>
		<li>
			Slippage model
		</li>
		<li>
			Validate orders and updates before they are submitted
		</li>
		<li>
			Default account type (margin or cash account)
		</li>
		<li>
			Support for extended market hours
		</li>
		<li>
			How splits and dividends are applied to open order tickets
		</li>
		<li>
			Default leverage for assets
		</li>
		<li>
			Default settlement models
		</li>
	</ul>
	This gives you enormous control over your algorithm behavior and allow you to model virtually any brokerage in the world.

	Brokerage models override any other models you may set for a security.
