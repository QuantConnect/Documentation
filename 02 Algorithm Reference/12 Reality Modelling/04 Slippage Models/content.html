	Slippage is the difference in price between your last reported quote and the real price the trade filled at.  This difference can be positive or negative, as sometimes the price can slip in your favor. In volatile markets you are likely to experience more slippage.

<p>
	Slippage models implement the $[ISlippageModel] interface. We provide the $[SpreadSlippageModel] for forex based securities, and the $[ConstantSlippageModel] for Equities.

	Advanced users may wish to implement their own volatility based slippage model - increasing the accuracy of your backtests in volatile markets.
