<p>
	Custom universes allow using an external data source as the security filtering source. Like normal custom data sources, custom universes are provided by extending BaseData. With this system you can define data formats to filter and select the data.

<p>
	Each <code>BaseData</code> of the custom universe is 1 line of the source file. The Reader method will be called repeatedly until the date/time advances or the end of file is reached. This way you the engine can group universe data together, and pass it as a single collection into the filter function.
