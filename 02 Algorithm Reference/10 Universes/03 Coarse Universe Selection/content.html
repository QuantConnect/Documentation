	Coarse Universe selection is the built in universe data provided by QuantConnect. Using financial data we generate a few key properties for each symbol and allow you to filter the universe of 16,400+ symbols to receive the symbols matching your filter criteria. It uses the $[CoarseFundamental] type.
</p>
<p>
	Coarse fundamental has the following properties you can use to perform rough filtering.<pre>class CoarseFundamental {
    public long Volume;             // Traded shares
    public decimal DollarVolume;    // Traded shares x Price
    public decimal Price;           // Yesterday close price
    public Symbol Symbol;           // Asset symbol
    public bool HasFundamentalData; // Whether it has fundamental
}</pre>
</p>
<p>
	Coarse filtering allows you to select an unlimited universe of symbols to analyse. You are only limited by practical memory and speed limits and may quickly run out of memory if you backtest too many symbols in parallel. These limits can be increased with a subscription.
