	Like coarse universes, fine universes allow you to select an unlimited universe of symbols to analyse. You are only limited by practical memory and speed limits and may quickly run out of memory if you backtest too many symbols in parallel. These limits can be increased with a subscription. Also you must use coarse fundamental universe to narrow down the universe as a "pre-filter".
