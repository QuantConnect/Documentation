	QuantConnect provides <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/data#provider/morningstar">Morningstar®</a> corporate 
	fundamentals data for US Equities symbols. The available dataset includes about 5000 ticker with 900 fields 
	starting from January 1998. It uses the $[FineFundamental] type.

	Like coarse universes, fine universes allow you to select an unlimited universe of symbols to analyse. 
	You are only limited by practical memory and speed limits and may quickly run out of memory if you backtest 
	too many symbols in parallel. These limits can be increased with a subscription. Also you must use coarse fundamental 
	universe to narrow down the universe as a "pre-filter".
