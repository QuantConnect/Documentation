<p><b>Adding Universes</b><br/>
Universes are added using the <code>AddUniverse()</code> method API. They are a type of data subscription which control what subscriptions are requested; and as such you can create <i>custom</i> universe data types. Depending on what type of universe you are adding there are many helper methods to make it easier. <code>AddUniverse()</code> methods take function filters as parameters, these filters must return an enumerable of Symbol objects.</p>
<p><b>Universe Settings</b><br/>
If you do not pass in a full universe object the  <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/lean/docs#topic458.html' target='_BLANK' class='lean-documentation' title='Open UniverseSettings API Documentation'>UniverseSettings </a>  property is used to fill in the blanks.  Changing the UniverseSettings algorithm property can be helpful to simplify adding universes. Universes have 4 key properties:

<pre>
    //Popular universe settings:
    UniverseSettings.Resolution      // What resolution should added assets use
                    .Leverage        // What leverage should assets use in the universe?
                    .Fillforward     // Should asset data fill forward?
                    .MinimumTimeInUniverse // Minimum time assets should be in universe
                    .ExtendedMarketHours  // Should assets also feed extended market hours?
</pre></p>
<p>Once added universes are stored in the <code>IDictionary&lt;string, Universe&gt; UniverseManager</code>.</p>
<p><b>Universe Events</b><br/>
When universe contents are changed (securities are added or removed from the algorithm) we generate an <code>OnSecuritiesChanged</code> event. This allows your algorithm to know the changes in the universe state. The event passes in the  <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/lean/docs#topic23864.html' target='_BLANK' class='lean-documentation' title='Open SecurityChanges API Documentation'>SecurityChanges </a>  object containing references to the Added and Removed securities.</p>
