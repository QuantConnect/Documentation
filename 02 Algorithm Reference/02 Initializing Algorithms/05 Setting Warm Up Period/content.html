	Often algorithms need some historical data to prime technical indicators, or populate historical data arrays. Using the <code>SetWarmUp(TimeSpan period)</code> or <code>SetWarmUp(int barCount)</code> methods you can specify a warm up period for your algorithm which pumps data in from before the start date. During the warm up period you cannot place a trade.

<p>
	Algorithms can use the <code>bool IsWarmingUp</code> property to determine if the warm up period has completed.
