	Algorithms can manually subscribe to data for specific assets they need, or use universes to choose groups of assets based on filtering criteria (e.g. all stocks with volumes greater than $10M/day). See more about Universes <a href="#Universes">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	To manually subscribe to a specific asset you can call the <code>AddEquity()</code>, <code>AddForex()</code>, <code>AddCfd()</code> and <code>AddOption()</code> methods in your Initialize() method. You can subscribe to 500 minute resolution datafeeds, 100 second resolutions feeds and 10 tick resolution datafeeds.

	QuantConnect supports international trading across multiple timezones and markets. Markets are used to distinguish between the same tickers on different exchanges (e.g. FXCM and OANDA both offer EURUSD, but have different rates).
</p>
<p>
	QuantConnect provides 40TB of US Equities, US Options, FXCM FX and OANDA FX data. Check out more information about our data in our <a href="/data">data library</a>.
</p>
<p>
	We provide data in tick, second, minute, hour or daily resolutions. These are specified by the <code>Resolution</code> enum.
</p>
<p>
	If there is a gap in the data (e.g. because there are no trades), by default the data is still pumped into your strategy on each time step. This behavior is called "fillForward" and defaults to true. You can disable this by setting fillForward to false.
</p>
<p>
	By default equity data in QuantConnect is Split and Dividend adjusted backwards in time to give smooth continuous prices. This allows easy  use for indicators. Some algorithms need raw or partially adjusted price data. You can control this with the <code>SetDataNormalizationMode()</code> method. The <code>DataNormalizationMode</code> enum has the values Adjusted (default), Raw, SplitAdjusted, and TotalReturn. When data is set to Raw mode the dividends are paid as cash into your algorithm and the splits are directly applied to your holding quantity.
