<p>
In QuantConnect, we model your algorithm with margin-modeling by default, but you can select a cash account type.
	Cash accounts do not allow leveraged trading, whereas Margin accounts support 2-4x leverage on your account value. You can set
	your brokerage account type in your initialization with $[SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName brokerage, AccountType account),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.SetBrokerageModel].
</p>
<p>
	The $[BrokerageName,T:QuantConnect.Brokerages.BrokerageName] enum supports values of Default, QuantConnectBrokerage, TradierBrokerage, InteractiveBrokersBrokerage, FxcmBrokerage, OandaBrokerage, Bitfinex, GDAX, Alpaca, and AlphaStreams. When setting the brokerage name, we also set the trading fee structures for that brokerage.
</p>
<p>
	The $[AccountType,T:QuantConnect.AccountType] enum supports values of Cash and Margin. When using cash, leverage is disabled by default, and the cash settlement period is set to 3 days for Equity securities. Margin accounts are settled immediately and have a leverage of 2.
</p>
<p>
	Margin accounts with more than $25,000 in equity are eligible for pattern day trading margin limits. This increases your available
	leverage to 4x while the market is open and 2x overnight. To model this behavior in your algorithm, you must set your security
	$[MarginModel,P:QuantConnect.Securities.Security.MarginModel] to <code>PatternDayTradingMarginModel</code>.
