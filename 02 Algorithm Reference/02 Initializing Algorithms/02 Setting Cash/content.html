	In backtests you can set your starting capital using the <code class="csharp visualbasic java">SetCash(decimal cash)</code><code class="python">self.SetCash(decimal cash)</code><code class="fsharp">this.SetCash(decimal cash)</code> method. In live trading this is ignored and your brokerage cash is used instead. In paper trading we set the cash to a fictional $100,000 USD (you can override the paper trading equity by clicking the "Live Algorithm Equity" button in your project tab).
