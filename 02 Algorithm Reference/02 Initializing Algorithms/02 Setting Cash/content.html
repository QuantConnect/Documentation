<p>
    In backtests you can set your starting capital using the 
    <code class="csharp visualbasic java">SetCash(decimal cash)</code>
    <code class="python">self.SetCash(decimal cash)</code>
    <code class="fsharp">this.SetCash(decimal cash)</code> method.
    
    In live trading this is ignored and your brokerage cash is used instead. 
    
    In paper trading we set the cash to a fictional $100,000 USD (you can override the paper trading equity by clicking the 
    "Live Algorithm Equity" button in your project tab).
