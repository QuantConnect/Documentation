<p>
	Algorithms can place an order through calling the appropriate method in the API. Going long is denoted 
	with a ordering positive number, and short a negative one. LEAN does not support hedging (long and short at the same time).
</p>
<p>
	Placing an order generates an $[OrderTicket] which you can use to update, cancel or check the status of your order.
</p>
<p>
	To update an order can call the Update method on the OrderTicket. The Update method takes an $[UpdateOrderFields] 
	object which defines what properties of the order should be updated. In the same way you can cancel 
	your order with the OrderTicket Cancel method.
</p>
<p>
	The OrderTicket Status property can be used to determine if the order is filled. The $[OrderStatus En] 
	has the values Submitted, PartiallyFilled, Filled, Cancelled or Invalid.
</p>
<p>
	The Transactions property is a helper that provides easy access to current and past orders and order tickets.
