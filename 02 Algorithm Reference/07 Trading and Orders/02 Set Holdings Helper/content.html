	Often portfolio based algorithms want to set the portfolio based on percentage weighting. We provide a helper method to perform this weighting for you called $[SetHoldings]. <pre class="prettyprint">
SetHoldings(Symbol symbol, double percentage, bool liquidateExistingHoldings = false)
</pre>
</p>
<p>
	When liquidate existing holdings is set to true any existing holdings will first be sold. This may be useful  when you're rebalancing to a new set of stocks. The $[Liquidate] method can achieve the same affect.<pre class="prettyprint">
Liquidate(Symbol symbolToLiquidate = null)
</pre>Liquidate sells all holdings in your portfolio, or just the ticker symbol if the parameter is specified.
</p>

	SetHoldings sets a fraction of unlevered equity. e.g. If you have 2x available leverage, and SetHoldings to 1.0 the algorithm will use 1.0 of your available buying power. To maximize buying power in this case you would make the SetHoldings fractions total 2.0.
