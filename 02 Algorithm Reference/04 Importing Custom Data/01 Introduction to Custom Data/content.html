	LEAN supports backtesting almost any external custom data source. To use this feature you need to add the data during initialize 
	using <code class="csharp">AddData&lt;T&gt;()</code> <code class="python">self.AddData()</code> and instruct your algorithm how 
	to read your data. We provide helpers for popular data sources like Quandl, but if you are using your own format or server you'll 
	need to create a custom type.
