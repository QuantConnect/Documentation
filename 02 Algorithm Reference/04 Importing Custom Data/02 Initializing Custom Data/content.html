	During initialize your algorithm must use 
	<span class="csharp">
		<code>AddData&lt;T&gt;(string ticker, Resolution resolution = Resolution.Daily)</code>. 
		This gives LEAN the T-type factory to create the objects, the name of the data and the resolution at which to poll the data 
		to check for updates.
	</span>
	<span class="python">
		<code>self.AddData(Type class, string ticker, Resolution resolution = Resolution.Daily)</code>. This gives LEAN the 
		type factory to create the data objects and the resolution to poll the remote datasource for updates. 
	</span>
</p>
<p>
	The framework checks for new data every as instructed by the <code>Resolution</code> period, i.e. Resolution.Tick polls constantly,
	Resolution.Second polls every second, and Resolution.Minute every minute. Hourly and Daily Resolutions are polled every 30 minutes 
	to prevent skipping a day if the data was emitted late.
