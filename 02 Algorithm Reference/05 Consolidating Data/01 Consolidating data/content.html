<p>Consolidators are used to combine smaller data points into larger bars. Commonly this is used to create 5, 10 or 15 minute bars from minute data. We provide tick, second, minute, hour and daily resolution bars which can be consolidated into any form you wish.</p>
<p>To use consolidators you create the consolidator class and then register it to receive data. Once you've registered the class it automatically gets data updates. Once it has aggregated the desired data it emits an event on the <code>DataConsolidated</code> event handler. You setup the consolidator and bind to this event handler once from inside your <code>Initialize()</code> method to prevent your algorithm from running out of memory.</p>
