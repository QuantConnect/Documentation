	If you'd like to have an indicator updated using a specific resolution of data; e.g. 30-period, 15-minute EMA; then you should ideally use the helper methods which come with the indicators. Most indicators handle setting up these resolution periods for you. See <a href="#Indicators">Indicators</a> for more information.
</p>
<p>
	You may have a custom indicator which doesn't have this helper. In this case you should register your indicator with the $[RegisterIndicator] function which will automatically create a consolidator and pipe the data into your Indicator class.
</p>
<p>
	In very rare cases you may want to update your indicator manually. You can do this by passing each data point into your <code>indicator.Update()</code> method from your consolidator <code>DataConsolidated</code> event handler.
