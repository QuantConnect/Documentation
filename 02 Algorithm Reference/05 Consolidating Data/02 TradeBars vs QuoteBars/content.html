	The specific consolidator you should use depends on the data and assets you're requesting. TradeBars should be consolidated with a $[TradeBarConsolidator]; QuoteBars with a $[QuoteBarConsolidator] and Ticks with a $[TickConsolidator]. Quote tick data must be consolidated by the $[TickQuoteBarConsolidator].
