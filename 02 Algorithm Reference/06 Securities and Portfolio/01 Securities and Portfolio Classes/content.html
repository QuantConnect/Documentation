	Algorithms have a <code>Securities</code> property which stores a <code>Security</code> object for each asset in 
	your algorithm. Security objects hold the models (backtesting behaviors) and properties of an asset. Each security 
	can be completely customized to behave as you'd like. Securities is a <code>Dictionary&lt;Symbol, Security&gt;</code> 
	so you can access your Security objects with their ticker <code>Securities["IBM"].Price</code>.

// Popular Securities Property Values:
Securities["IBM"].HasData           // Security has data 
                 .Invested          // Have holdings
                 .LocalTime         // Time on the asset exchange
                 .Holdings          // Portfolio object
                 .Exchange          // Exchange information
                 .FeeModel;         // Fee model setter
</pre>
</p>
<p>
	Security objects also carry all the models for creating realistic backtests. These models are set via the public 
	security properties and then used in LEAN to improve your backtest realism.
</p>
<p>
	The Portfolio property is a collection of SecurityHolding objects to provide easy access to the holding properties. 
	The Portfolio class is a <code>Dictionary&lt;Symbol, SecurityHolding&gt;</code> so can be accessed via ticker index: 
	<code>Portfolio["IBM"].IsLong</code>
</p>
<p>
<pre class="csharp">
// Popular Portfolio Property Values:
Portfolio["IBM"].Invested 
                .IsLong            // IsLong, IsShort Holdings.
                .Quantity          // Shares held.
                .UnrealizedProfit; // Holdings profit/loss
                .TotalFees         // Fees incurred since backtest start
                .Price;            // Asset price
