<p>
	There are six financial data types: TradeBars, Ticks, Delistings, SymbolChangedEvents, Splits and Dividends.
</p>
<p>
	All data extends from $[BaseData] - the core data class which provides Symbol, Time and Value properties.
</p>
<p>
	$[TradeBar] events contains Open, High, Low, Close and Volume properties for a given period of time.
</p>
<p>
	$[Dividend C] events are triggered on payment of a dividend. It provides the Distribution per share.
</p>
<p>
	$[Split] events are triggered on a share split or reverse split event. It provides a SplitFactor and ReferencePrice.
</p>
<p>
	$[SymbolChangedEvent] provide notice of new ticker names for stocks, or mergers of two tickers into one. It provides the OldSymbol and NewSymbol tickers.
</p>
<p>
	$[Delisting] events provide notice an asset is no longer trading on the exchange.
</p>
<p>
	$[Ticks C] is a string indexed dictionary of lists of ticks.
</p>
<p class="csharp">
	These data types all have dedicated event handlers which follow the pattern above (<code>public void OnData(Type data) {}</code>);
	and are also passed into the OnData(Slice data) event handler.
</p>
<p class="python">
	All these data types are accessible through their properties on the slice object. i.e.
	<ul>
		<li><code>slice.Bars</code></li>
		<li><code>slice.Ticks</code></li>
		<li><code>slice.Splits</code></li>
		<li><code>slice.Dividends</code></li>
		<li><code>slice.Delistings</code></li>
		<li><code>slice.SymbolChangedEvents</code></li>
	</ul>
