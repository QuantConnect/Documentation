	Requested data is passed into event handlers for you to use to make trading decisions. The primary event handler, Slice,
	groups all data types together at a single moment in time in the
	<code class="csharp fsharp">OnData(Slice data)</code><code class="python">def OnData(self, slice):</code> handler. Slice is short
	for "time slice" - representing a slice of time and values of the data at that time.
	<span class="csharp fsharp"> C# and F# also allow  you to receive data with dedicated event handlers for each data type
	e.g $[OnData(TradeBars data),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.OnData].</span><span class="python">Python only supports the Slice event handlers.</span>
</p>
<p>
	All data uses <code>DataDictionary</code> objects to group data by symbol and provide easy access to information. The plural of
	the type denotes the collection of objects (e.g., the <i>TradeBars</i> DataDictionary is made up of <i>TradeBar</i> objects; <i>QutoeBars</i> DataDictionary is made up of <i>QuoteBar</i> objects). You
	can access individual data points in the dictionary through its string or symbol dictionary index. For example 
	<code class="csharp fsharp">var ibmTradeBar = slice.Bars["IBM"]</code>
	<code class="python">ibmTradeBar = slice["IBM"]</code>.
