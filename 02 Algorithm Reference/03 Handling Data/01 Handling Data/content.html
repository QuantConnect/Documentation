	Requested data is passed into event handlers for you to use to make trading decisions. The primary event handler, Slice, groups all data types together at a single moment in time in the <code>OnData(Slice data)</code> handler. Slice is short for "time slice" - representing a slice of time and values of the data at that time. <span class="csharp fsharp"> C# and F# also allow  you to receive data with dedicated event handlers for each data type e.g <code>OnData(TradeBars data)</code>.</span><span class="python">Python only supports the Slice event handlers.</span>
</p>
<p>
	All data uses <code>DataDictionary</code> objects to group data by symbol and provide easy access to information. The plural of the type denotes the collection of objects e.g. the <i>TradeBars</i> DataDictionary is made up of <i>TradeBar</i> objects. You can access individual data points in the dictionary through its string or symbol dictionary index. For example <code>var ibmTradeBar = tradebars["IBM"]</code>.
