		In C#/F# data is also piped into dedicated event handlers for each data type. To use data this way you 
		need to put an event handler in your algorithm which follows the pattern: 
		<code> public void OnData(TradeBars data) {}</code>. LEAN automatically detects the method exists and sends data to it.

	<span class="python">
		Python does not support dedicated event data handlers. Slice is the preferred way to access data for your strategy.

	When working with Ticks they can occur at the same moment of time across different exchanges. Because of this we provide the ticks
	as a list. In backtesting this moment is stepped each second and you will get many ticks per second; in live trading it is stepped
	as fast as possible and you will probably get 1 tick per event. 
	
	<span class="csharp"> The <code>public void OnData(Ticks data) {}</code> event handler captures these events. </span>
