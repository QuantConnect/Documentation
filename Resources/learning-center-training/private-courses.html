<p>Private courses are not for sale in the Learning Center. You can upload private courses to your <a href="/organization/resources" class='menu-name'>Organization &gt; Resources</a> page, but they will not be available for other organizations to purchase. Create private courses to help onboard your team members while using the familiar Learning Center environment. Since the Learning Center has built-in tools to help you monitor your team members, you can track the progress of your team members as they work on your internal private courses.</p><p>This feature is designed for Institutional clients with large teams of quants on QuantConnect</p>
