<p>Follow these steps to use autocomplete:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href='<?=$projectLink?>'>Open a project</a>.</li>
    <li>Type the first few characters of a variable, function, class, or class member that you want to autocomplete (for example, <code class='python'>self.set</code><code class='csharp'>Set</code> or <code>SimpleMovingAverage.Upda</code>).</li>
    <li>Press <span class='key-combinations'>CTRL+Space</span>.</li>
    <p>If there are class members that match the characters you provided, a list of class members displays.</p>
