<p>When you call one of the order methods to place an order, LEAN performs pre-order checks to ensure that the order meets some requirements and uses the last known price to check you have <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/buying-power'>enough capital</a>. To see the requirements of each order, see the <span class='page-section-name'>Requirements</span> section of <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/key-concepts#03-Order-Types'>the documentation for the order types</a> and the <span class='page-section-name'>Orders</span> section of your <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages/supported-models'>brokerage model</a>. If you can place the order, LEAN creates <code>Order</code> and <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-management/order-tickets'>OrderTicket</a> objects. The order ticket is sent to your brokerage. As the brokerage processes your order, it returns another order ticket and it's compared against the order to see if the order is satisfied. Orders are asynchronous in live trading, so if you want to change an order, you must request it with the order ticket. Order changes are not guaranteed since your order may fill by the time brokerage receives the request.</p>
