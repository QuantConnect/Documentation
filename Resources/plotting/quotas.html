<p>Custom charts are limited to 4,000 data points. Intensive charting requires hundreds of megabytes of data, which is too much to stream online or display in a web browser. If you exceed the quota, the following message displays:</p>
<p><span class='error-messages'>Exceeded maximum points per chart, data skipped</span></p>

<p>You can create up to 10 custom chart series per algorithm. If you exceed the quota, your algorithm stops executing and the following message displays:</p>
<p><span class='error-messages'>Exceeded maximum series count: Each backtest can have up to 10 series in total.</span></p>

<p>In live trading, charts are sampled every one and ten minutes. If you create 1-minute resolution custom charts, the IDE charting will downgrade the granularity and display the 10-minutes sampling after a certain amount of samples.</p>
