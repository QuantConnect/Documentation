<p>If you <?=$research ? "use the Research Environment" : "run algorithms" ?> locally, you can store as much data as your hardware will allow. If you <?=$research ? "use the Research Environment" : "run algorithms" ?> in QuantConnect Cloud, you must stay within your <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/object-store#04-Storage-Sizes'>storage quota</a>. If you need more storage space, <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/object-store#07-Edit-Storage-Plan'>edit your storage plan</a>.</p>
