<p>The Object Store is a file system that you can use in your algorithms to save, read, and delete data. The Object Store is organization-specific, so you can save or read data from the same Object Store in all of your organization's projects. The Object Store works like a key-value storage system where you can store regular strings, JSON encoded strings, XML encoded strings, and bytes. You can access the data you store in the Object Store from backtests, the Research Environment, and live algorithms.</p>
