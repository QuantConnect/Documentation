<p>Most Renko consolidators aggregate bars based on a fixed price movement. The <code>RenkoConsolidator</code> produces Renko bars by their traditional definition. A <code>RenkoConsolidator</code> with a bar size of $1 produces a new bar that spans $1 every time an asset closes $1 above the high of the previous bar or $1 below the low of the previous bar. If the price jumps multiple dollars in a single tick, the <code>RenkoConsolidator</code> produces multiple $1 bars in a single time step.</p>
