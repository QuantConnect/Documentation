  Most Range consolidators aggregate bars based on a fixed price movement. It is very much like a Renko Bar, but instead of consolidating a fix movement from the opening price,
  a Range Bar would fix the range of the whole bar, i.e. High - Low. A new bar is formed when the range of the whole bar reached a preset value, thus it completely neglects the time
  effect and focuses on the variance/information carried by the price movement.
