<p>Identity consolidators are data pass through. This type of consolidator does not aggregate samples but instead passes each data point through as-is. You can use this consolidator to <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/manual-indicators#05-Automatic-Updates">register indicators</a> that require every data point without any aggregation or sequential consolidators.</p>

<p>Filtered Identity consolidators are a particular type that allows filtering the data. For example, you can filter out unwanted data points before they reach your indicators.</p>
