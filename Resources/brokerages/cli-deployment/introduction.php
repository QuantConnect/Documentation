    The Lean CLI supports live trading on your local machine or in QuantConnect Cloud, which makes the transfer from backtesting to live trading as seamless as possible. This page contains instructions on how to start live trading with the <?=$brokerageName?> brokerage. If the <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/initialization/configuration#03-Lean-Configuration'>Lean Configuration file</a> in your <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/initialization/organization-workspaces'>organization workspace</a> contains values for some of the command options, the CLI skips some of the prompts.
