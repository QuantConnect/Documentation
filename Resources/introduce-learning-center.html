<p>The Learning Center is a coding environment to learn quantitative trading using LEAN. The Learning Center features a collection of courses from educators from the QuantConnect team and the community. The goal of the Learning Center is to give you an understanding of robust algorithm design and the tools you need to implement your own trading strategies. As you work through the courses, you’ll manage a portfolio, use indicators in technical trading strategies, trade on universes of assets, automate trades based on market behavior, and understand how data moves through your algorithm. After you've completed a course, you can keep the code to perform further research and deploy to live trading. Start learning today because you need to complete 30% of the Bootcamp lessons to post in the community forum.</p>
