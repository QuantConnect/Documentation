<p>Migrating moves a project from one organization to another. You must be the organization administrator to migrate projects out of the organization. Migrate a project to run the project using resources from a different organization and to collaborate on the project with members from a different organization. When you migrate projects, the project files are copied but the content stored in the Object Store is not retained.</p>
