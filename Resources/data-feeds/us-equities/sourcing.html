<p>The US Equities data feed consolidates market data across all of the exchanges. Over-the-Counter (OTC) trades are excluded. The data feed is powered by the Securities Information Processor (SIP), so it has 100% market coverage. In contrast, free platforms that display data feeds like the Better Alternative Trading System (BATS) only have <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href='https://www.xignite.com/faqs/stocks-and-etfs-data/why-is-the-volume-on-bats-cboe-lower-than-other-exchanges/'>about 6-7% market coverage</a>.</p>

<p>We provide live splits, dividends, and corporate actions for US companies. We deliver them to your algorithm before the trading day starts.</p>
