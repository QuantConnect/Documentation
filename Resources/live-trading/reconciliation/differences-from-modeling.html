<p>The modeling that your algorithm uses can cause differences between backtesting and live trading performance.</p>

<h4>Reality Modeling Error</h4>
<p>We provide <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/brokerages">brokerage models</a> to model fees, slippage, and order fills in backtests. However, these model predictions may not always match the fees that your live algorithm incurs, leading to deviations between backtesting and live trading. You can adjust the reality models that your algorithm uses to more accurately reflect the specific assets that you're trading. For more information about reality models, see <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/key-concepts">Reality Modeling</a>. </p>

<h4>Market Impact</h4>
<p>We don't currently model market impact. So, if you are trading large orders, your fill prices can be better during backtesting than live trading, causing deviations between backtesting and live trading. To avoid issues, implement a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/trade-fills/key-concepts#04-Model-Structure">custom fill model</a> in your backtests that incorporates market impact.</p>

<h4>Fills</h4>
<p>In backtests, orders fill immediately. In live trading, they are sent to your brokerage and take about half a second to execute. If you fill an order in a backtest with stale data, deviations between backtesting and live trading can occur because the order is filled at a price that is likely different from the real market price. Stale order fills commonly occur in backtests when you create a Scheduled Event with an incompatible data resolution. For instance, if you subscribe to hourly data, place a Scheduled Event for 11:15 AM, and fill an order during the Scheduled Event, the order will fill at a stale price because the data between 11:00 AM and 11:15 AM is missing. To avoid stale fills, only place orders when your algorithm receives price data.<br></p>

<p>In live trading, your brokerage provides the fill price of your orders. Since the backtesting brokerage models do not know the price at which live orders are filled, the fill price of backtest orders is based on
 the best price available in the current backtesting data. Similarly, limit orders can fill at different prices between backtesting and live trading. In backtesting, limit orders fill as soon as the limit price is hit. In live trading, your brokerage may fill the same limit order at a different price or fail to fill the order, depending on the position of your order in their order book.<br></p>

<h4>Borrowing Costs</h4>
<p>We do not currently simulate the cost of borrowing shorts in backtests. Therefore, if your algorithm takes short positions, deviations can occur between backtesting and live trading. We are working on adding the functionality to model borrowing fees.
