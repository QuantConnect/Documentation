<p>When you place Crypto trades, ensure you have a sufficient balance of the base or quote currency before each trade. If you hold multiple assets and you want to put all of your capital into BTCUSDT, you need to first convert all your non-BTC assets into USDT and then purchase BTCUSDT.</p>

<p>By default, the account currency is USD and your starting cash is $100,000. Some Crypto exchanges don't support fiat currencies, which means you can't convert the $100,000 USD to the pair's <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/key-concepts#05-Quote-Currency'>quote currency</a>.

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">SetAccountCurrency("USDT", 1000);   // Set account currency to Thether and its quantity to 1000 USDT</pre>
<pre class="python">self.SetAccountCurrency("USDT", 1000)   # Set account currency to Thether and its quantity to 1000 USDT</pre>
