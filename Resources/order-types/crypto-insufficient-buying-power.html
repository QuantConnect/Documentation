Some Crypto exchanges don't support fiat currencies, which means you can't convert the $100,000 USD to the pair's <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/key-concepts#05-Quote-Currency'>quote currency</a>.

<pre class="python">self.set_account_currency("USDT", 1000)   # Set account currency to Thether and its quantity to 1000 USDT</pre>
