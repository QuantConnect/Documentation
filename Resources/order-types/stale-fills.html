<p>Stale fills occur when you fill an order with price data that is timestamped an hour or more into the past. Stale fills usually only occur if you trade illiquid assets or if your algorithm uses daily data but you trade intraday with Scheduled Events. If your order is filled with stale data, the fill price may not be realistic. The pre-built fill models can only fill market orders with stale data. To adjust the length of time that needs to pass before an order is considered stale, set the <code class="csharp">StalePriceTimeSpan</code><code class="python">stale_price_time_span</code> setting.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">Settings.StalePriceTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10);</pre>
<pre class="python">self.settings.stale_price_time_span = timedelta(minutes=10)</pre>
</div>
