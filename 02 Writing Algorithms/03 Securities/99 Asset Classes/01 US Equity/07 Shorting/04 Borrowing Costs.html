<p>In live trading, you usually pay a fee to borrow shares that you use to open a short position. The fee goes to the investor that provided you with the opportunity to short with their shares. The fee usually comes from your live brokerage. In backtests, LEAN doesn't currently model borrowing costs, but we have an open GitHub Issue to add the functionality.
