<p>There is no limit to the number of securities to which you can subscribe. However, some live data providers impose data subscription limits. To set a limit, in the <code>Initialize</code> method, set the <code>DataSubscriptionLimit</code> <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/initialization#10-Set-Algorithm-Settings'>algorithm setting</a>.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">Settings.DataSubscriptionLimit = 500;</pre>
    <pre class="python">self.Settings.DataSubscriptionLimit = 500</pre>
</div>

<p>All securities that you add to the algorithm count as one subscription, except Options and Futures. Every Option and Future contract counts as one subscription.</p>
