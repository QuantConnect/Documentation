		In C#, data is also piped into dedicated event handlers for each data type. To use data this way, you 
		need to put an event handler in your algorithm that follows the pattern: 
		<code> public void OnData(TradeBars data) {}</code>. LEAN automatically detects the method exists and sends data to it.
	</span>
	<span class="python">
		Python passes all data events into the <code>def OnData(self, slice):</code> event handler. This is the preferred way to
		access data for your strategy. This includes all the data you've requested for your algorithm, including custom data.
