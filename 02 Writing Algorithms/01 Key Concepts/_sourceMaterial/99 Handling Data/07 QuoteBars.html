    QuoteBars are built by consolidating the bid and ask ticks from the exchanges into bars. The  $[QuoteBar,T:QuantConnect.Data.Market.QuoteBar] provides Open, High, Low, Close, Bid, Ask, LastBidSize, and LastAskSize properties for a given period of time. The Bid and the Ask properties are $[Bar,T:QuantConnect.Data.Market.Bar] objects that contain Open, High, Low, and Close. The QuoteBar Open, High, Low, and Close properties values are the mean of the respective Bid and Ask properties. QuoteBars are supported for all asset types. <br></p><p>## TODO: The Low of a QuoteBar is not always the mean. If there is no data for the bid/ask at the current slice, it selects either the AskLow or the BidLow<br></p>

    With a specific QuoteBar, you can also access Bid and Ask Bars for the same security. These Bars provide information specific to the Bid and Ask side of Forex and Future asset types, while the QuoteBar.Open, High, Low, and Close properties are the midpoint of the Bid-Ask spread at that moment of time. These QuoteBar.Bid and QuoteBar.Ask bars have Open, High, Low, and close properties (e.g., <code>QuoteBar.Bid.Open</code>).
