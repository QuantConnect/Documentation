<p>Bars have a start and end time that represent the time period of which the bar bar aggregates data. LEAN passes the bar to your algorithm at the end time so that you don't receive the bar before it was actually available. Other data providers commonly timestamp their bars to the start time of the bar. This can cause one-off errors when you <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/importing-data/key-concepts'>import the data</a> into QC or compare indicator values across different platforms.</p>
