<p>Point values have no period because they occur at a singular point in time. Examples of point data includes ticks, <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/asset-classes/equity-options/handling-data#07-Open-Interest'>open interest</a>, and news releases. Tick data represents a single trade or quote in the market. It's a discrete event with no period, so the <code>Time</code> and <code>EndTime</code> properties are the same. LEAN emits ticks as soon as they arrive and doesn't fill them forward.</p>
