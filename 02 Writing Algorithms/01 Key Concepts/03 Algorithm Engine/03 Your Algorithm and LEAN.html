  <li>How does your algorithm plug into LEAN?</li>
  <p>Your algorithm is a subclass of QCAlgorithm that is loaded into the engine during the building/compilation process. It means that changes to your algorithm require a new compilation.</p>
  <li>What does LEAN Manage for your Algorithm?</li>
  <p>LEAN runs an algorithm manager that synchronizes the data that your algorithm subscribed to, updates your algorithm state (e.g. the price of the securities, consolidators, indicators), processes the orders, and delivers the data for trading decisions.</p>
</ol>

<meta name="tag" content="using quantconnect">
<p>
	QuantConnect's LEAN engine manages your portfolio and data feeds, letting you focus on your algorithm strategy and execution.
	Data is piped into your strategy via event handlers, upon which you can place trades. We automatically provide basic portfolio management
	and fill modeling underneath the hood. This is provided by the $[QCAlgorithm,T:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm] base class.
</p>
<p>
	All algorithms extend $[QCAlgorithm,T:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm], which provides some key helper properties for you to use: Security Manager,
	Portfolio Manager, Transactions Manager, Notification Manager, and Scheduling Manager. Along with hundreds of helper methods
	to make the API easy to use. We'll go into more detail in the next few sections.
</p>
<p>
	The $[Securities,P:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.Securities] <span class="csharp fsharp python">property</span>
	 is a dictionary of Security objects. Each asset (equity, forex pair, etc) in your algorithm has a security object. All the models for a security live on these objects:
	e.g.
		<span class="csharp fsharp">
			<code>Securities["IBM"].FeeModel</code> or <code>Securities["IBM"].Price</code>.
		</span>
		<span class="python">
			<code>self.Securities["IBM"].FeeModel</code> or <code>self.Securities["IBM"].Price</code>.
		</span>
</p>
<p>
	$[Portfolio,P:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.Portfolio] is a dictionary of SecurityHolding classes.
	These classes track the individual portfolio items profit and losses, fees, and quantity held. e.g.
	<code class="csharp fsharp">Portfolio["IBM"].LastTradeProfit</code>
	<code class="python">self.Portfolio["IBM"].LastTradeProfit</code>.
</p>
<p>
	Other helpers like $[Transactions,P:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.Transactions], $[Schedule,P:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.Schedule], $[Notify,P:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.Notify], and $[Universe,P:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.Universe] have their
	own helper methods, which we'll explain in the following sections.
