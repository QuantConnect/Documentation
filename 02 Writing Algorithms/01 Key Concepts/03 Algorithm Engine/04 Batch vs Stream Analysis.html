Backtesting platforms come in two general varieties, batch processing or event streaming.

<p>Batch processing backtesting is much simpler. It loads all data into an array and passes it to your algorithm for analysis. Because your algorithm has access to future data points, it is easy to introduce look-ahead bias. Most home-grown analysis tools are batch systems.</p>

QuantConnect/LEAN is a streaming analysis system. In live trading, data points are generated one after another over time. QuantConnect models this in backtesting, streaming data to your algorithm in fast-forward. Because of this, you do not have access to price data beyond the Time Frontier. Although streaming analysis is slightly trickier to understand, it allows your algorithm to seamlessly work in backtests and live trading with no code changes.
