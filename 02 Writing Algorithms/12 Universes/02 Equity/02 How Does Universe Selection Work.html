<p>Universe Selection sends a large data set into a filter function. After passing through your filters, the algorithm needs you to return an array of <code>Symbol</code> objects. LEAN automatically subscribes to these new symbols and adds them to your algorithm.</p>

<p>Your algorithm can do almost anything inside your filter functions, but the goal should be to narrow down the 8,000 daily stocks to a few which are most applicable for your algorithm.</p>

<p>The first stage of the filter is called "Coarse Universe Selection". This is for roughly filtering down the universe by simple properties like price and volume. The <i>result</i> of this is piped into the Fine Universe Selection function to perform selection on fundamental data like PE Ratio and Earnings.</p>



## TODO: <br><div>- Explain that AddEquity should not be used to add securities that Universe Selection has added since they are added to a different universe (user-defined universe)</div><div>- Universe.Unchanged<br></div>
