<p>
The <code>Train</code> feature allows you to get an increase in computation time to perform your model training for your machine learning strategies. Normally algorithms must perform all necessary work within 10 minutes before returning from the OnData method. With the training features, these limits have been increased to more than 30 minutes to give you time to run your models.
</p>

<p style="">
<i class="fa fa-warning"></i> <b>Important:</b> In backtesting, the <code>Train</code> method is <em>synchronous</em> and will block your program execution while the model is executed. However, in live trading, it runs <em>asynchronously</em>. Because of this, you should be careful to ensure your model is ready to use before continuing program execution. This training occurs on a separate thread, so we recommend a boolean flag to notify your algorithm of the model state. We post some examples of this in the Examples section below.
</p>

<h4>Initializing a Model</h4>
<p>
Models can be trained immediately with the <code>Train()</code> method. This is most useful for training the model immediately on the deployment of your strategy to production or when its performance begins to degrade.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container" >
<pre class="csharp">// Trigger a training immediately in your training method.
Train(MyTrainingMethod);</pre>
<pre class="python"># Trigger a training immediately in your training method.
self.Train(self.MyMethod)</pre> 
</div>

<h4>Scheduling Training</h4>
<p>
Model training can be scheduled in a similar way to a scheduled event. To do this, you need to pass in a <code>DateRule</code> and <code>TimeRule</code> argument to the <code>Train</code> method. You can see a full list of available date and time rules in the <a href="/docs/algorithm-reference/scheduled-events" class="docs-internal-link">scheduled event</a> documentation.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container" >
<pre class="csharp">// Set TrainingMethod to be executed at 8:00 am every Sunday
Train(DateRules.Every(DayOfWeek.Sunday), TimeRules.At(8, 0), MyTrainingMethod);</pre>
<pre class="python"># Set TrainingMethod to be executed at 8:00 am every Sunday
self.Train(self.DateRules.Every(DayOfWeek.Sunday), self.TimeRules.At(8,0), self.MyTrainingMethod)</pre> 
</div>
<p>We recommend scheduling your training for the evening or early mornings when the market is closed to get the best compute allocation. While the market is open, your CPU is occupied with processing incoming tick data and handling other LEAN events.</p>

<h4>Training Limits</h4>
<p>Training resources are allocated with a <a target="_BLANK" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket">leaky bucket algorithm</a> where a maximum of n-minutes can be used in a single training, and the allocated compute refills over time. This gives you burst allocations when needed and recharges the allowance to prepare for the next training. Limits are configured by server type according to the table below.
