QuantConnect allows you to request historical data in many different formats. In this section, we'll cover each of these formats and how you can use them in your algorithm. Broadly, there are two ways to use these data requests: direct historical data requests and indirect algorithm warm up.

A direct historical data request fetches any historical data you request at any time for a given <a href="/docs/key-concepts/security-identifiers" class="docs-internal-link">Symbol</a>. This gives you the most control to apply the data as you need. Indirect algorithm warm-up winds back the start time of your algorithm and feeds it with historical data, simulating a real data feed. Warm-up is best for quickly restoring the state of a fixed set of assets.

Below we'll explore these two options and how you can use them in your algorithm.
