<p>The Cross Asset Model by ExtractAlpha provides stock scoring values based on the trading activity in the Options market. Since the Options market has a higher proportion of institutional traders than the Equities market, the Options market is composed of investors who are more informed and information-driven on average. The data covers a dynamic universe of over 3,000 US Equities, starts in July 2005, and is delivered on a daily frequency. This dataset is created by feature engineering on the Options market put-call spread, volatility skewness, and volume.</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>
