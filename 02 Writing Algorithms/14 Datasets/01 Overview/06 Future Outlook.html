<p>The Dataset Market is still in the early phases of development. Over time, we will add more markets and alternative datasets. Alternative datasets are an ever-expanding data source, so it’s expected to continue to grow into the future. In today’s digital world, more data is created each year than the preceding year. To take advantage of the trend, we have implemented a new <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/datasets/contributing-datasets">onboarding process</a> to integrate many new alternative data sources into the QuantConnect platform. With the Dataset Market, you can import a new alternative dataset into your trading algorithm with just a single line of code. The Dataset Market gives everyone the ability to access high-quality alternative datasets that were previously only accessible to major hedge funds.</p>
