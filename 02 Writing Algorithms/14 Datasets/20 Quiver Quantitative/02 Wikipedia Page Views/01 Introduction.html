<p>The Wikipedia Page Views dataset by Quiver Quantitative tracks Wikipedia page views for US Equities. The data covers 1,300 US Equities, starts in October 2016, and is delivered on a daily frequency. This dataset is created by scraping the Wikipedia pages of companies.</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>
