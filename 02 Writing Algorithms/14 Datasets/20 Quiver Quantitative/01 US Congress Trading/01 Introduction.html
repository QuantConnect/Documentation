<p>The US Congress Trading dataset by Quiver Quantitative tracks US Equity trades made by members of Congress in the Senate and the House of Representatives. The data covers 1,800 US Equities, starts in January 2016, and is delivered on a daily frequency. This dataset is created by scraping SEC reports.</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>
