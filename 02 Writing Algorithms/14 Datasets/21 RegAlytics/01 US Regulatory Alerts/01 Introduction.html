<p>The US Regulatory Alerts dataset by RegAlytics tracks US regulatory changes. The data covers 40,000 alerts, starts from January 2020, and is delivered on a daily basis. This dataset is created by sourcing information from over 3,000 regulators and using proprietary technology to gather and structure the regulatory data. Once prepared, the data is thoroughly reviewed by RegAlytics' team of regulatory experts and delivered each morning by 8AM for industry use.</p>

<p>This dataset depends on the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master">US Equity Security Master</a> dataset because the US Equity Security Master dataset contains information on splits, dividends, and symbol changes.</p>
