<p>This indicator computes the On Balance Volume (OBV). The On Balance Volume is calculated by determining the price of the current close price and previous close price. If the current close price is equivalent to the previous price the OBV remains the same, If the current close price is higher the volume of that day is added to the OBV, while a lower close price will result in negative value.</p>
