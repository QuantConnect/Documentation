It's not always necessary to create manual indicators though. If your algorithm only uses a static universe and you want to update the indicator with data from the security subscription, create an <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/automatic-indicators">automatic indicator</a>.
