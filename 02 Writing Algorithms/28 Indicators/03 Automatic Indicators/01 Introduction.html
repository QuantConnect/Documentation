<p>Automatic indicators are indicators that automatically update from the underlying security data. Automatic indicators do everything that manual indicators do, but with automatic updates registered for you. If you have a dynamic universe, you shouldn't use automatic indicators because you can't remove the consolidator that updates the indicator. Since you can't remove the consolidator, the consolidators build up over time and slow down your algorithm. If your algorithm has a dynamic universe, use <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/manual-indicators">manual indicators</a> instead.</p>
