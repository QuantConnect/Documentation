<p>This page describes some of the pre-built fee models in LEAN. For more brokerage-specific fee mdoels, see the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/brokerages">brokerage integration documentation pages</a>. If none of these models perform exactly how you want, create a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/transaction-fees/key-concepts#04-Model-Structure">custom fee model</a>.</p>
