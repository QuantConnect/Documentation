<p>A trade fill is the price at which your brokerage executes your order in the market. Fill models model how each type of order fills to accurately simulate the behavior of a real brokerage. Fill models determine the price and quantity of your fills, can incorporate spread costs, and work with the slippage model to add slippage into the fill price. If you trade US Equities, our built-in fill models can fill your orders at the official opening and closing auction prices.</p>
