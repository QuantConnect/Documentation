<p>To access historical bars that were passed to your consolidation handler, save the bars as they are produced. You can use a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/historical-data/rolling-window">RollingWindow</a> to save the consolidated bars and easily access them later on in your algorithm.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Create a class member to store the RollingWindow
_window = new RollingWindow&lt;TradeBar&gt;(2);

// In the consolidation handler, add consolidated bars to the RollingWindow
private void ConsolidationHandler(object sender, TradeBar consolidatedBar)
{
    _window.Add(consolidatedBar);
}</pre>
<pre class="python"># Create a class member to store the RollingWindow
self.window = RollingWindow[TradeBar](2)

# In the consolidation handler, add consolidated bars to the RollingWindow
def consolidation_handler(self, sender: object, consolidated_bar: TradeBar) -&gt; None:
    self.window.Add(consolidated_bar)</pre>
</div>
