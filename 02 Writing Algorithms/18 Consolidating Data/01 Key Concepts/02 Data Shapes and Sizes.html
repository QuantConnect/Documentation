<p>Consolidators usually produce output data that is the same format as the input data. They aggregate small <code>TradeBar</code> objects into a large <code>TradeBar</code>, small <code>QuoteBar</code> objects into a large <code>QuoteBar</code>, and <code>Tick</code> objects into either a <code>TradeBar</code> or <code>QuoteBar</code>.<br></p>

<p>Many asset classes in QuantConnect have data for both trades and quotes. By default, consolidators aggregate data into <code>TradeBar</code> objects. Forex data is the only exception, which consolidators aggregate into <code>QuoteBar</code> objects since Forex data doesn't have <code>TradeBar</code> objects.</p>
