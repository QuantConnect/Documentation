	Intensive charting generates hundreds of megabytes (200MB) of data, which is far too much to stream online or display in a web browser. Because of this, we limit the number of points a chart can have to 4000. If you see the error <code>Exceeded maximum points per chart, data skipped</code>, then you have hit this limit and should reduce your sampling frequency.
