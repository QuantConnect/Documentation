<p>This page describes the pre-built Portfolio Optimizer models in LEAN. The number of models grows over time. To add a model to LEAN, make a pull request to the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/tree/master/Algorithm.Framework/Portfolio">GitHub repository</a>. If none of these models perform exactly how you want, create a <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/portfolio-construction/key-concepts#08-Portfolio-Optimizer-Structure'>custom Portfolio Optimizer model</a>.</p>
