<p>In live trading, the securities in your brokerage account are added to your user-defined universe. If your Universe Selection model doesn't select these securities, they are not removed from your user-defined universe. When you liquidate the positions, you can remove them from the user-defined universe. In fact, if you call the <code>RemoveSecurity</code> method, it automatically liquidates the position.</p>

<p>To see the securities in your user-defined universe that were loaded from your brokerage account, check your algorithm's <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/universes/key-concepts#10-Active-Securities'>ActiveSecurities</a> in the <code>OnWarmUpFinished</code> event handler.</p>
