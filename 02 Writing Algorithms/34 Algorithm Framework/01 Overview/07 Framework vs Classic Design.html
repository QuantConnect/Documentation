<p>You should choose the classic or Algorithm Framework design based on the needs of your algorithm. If your algorithm uses special order types or passes information between the different algorithm components, use the classic design. If you can reuse existing modules and the Algorithm Framework modules can work in isolation, use the Algorithm Framework design.</p>
