The Algorithm Framework performs real-time analysis into the effectiveness of your strategy and calculates various scores on your algorithm. These scores can be used to help you quickly identify areas of weakness to improve your models. There are three key scores calculated based on the <b>Alpha Model</b> insights: Direction Score, Magnitude Score, and Estimated Alpha Value.

<p>Scoring an algorithm is a balance of art and science. Between the start of your Insight signal and the end of your timeframe, there are infinite variations in the price movements. To address this, we've created scoring functions which assign weight based on time.</p>
