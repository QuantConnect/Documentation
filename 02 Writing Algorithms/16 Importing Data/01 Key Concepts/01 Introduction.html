<p>Custom data is your own external data that's not from the Dataset Market. You can use custom data to inform trading decisions and to simulate trades on unsupported securities. To get custom data into your algorithms, you <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/importing-data/bulk-downloads">download the entire file at once</a> or <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/importing-data/streaming-data/key-concepts">read it line-by-line</a> with a custom data reader. If you use a custom data reader, LEAN sends the data to the <code>OnData</code> method in your algorithm.</p>
