<p>This page explains how to creates a new <code>ChandeMomentumOscillator</code> indicator.</p>
                        
<p>This indicator computes the Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO). CMO calculation is mostly identical to RSI. The only difference is in the last step of calculation: RSI = gain / (gain+loss) CMO = (gain-loss) / (gain+loss)</p>
