<p>This page explains how to creates a new <code>RegressionChannel</code> indicator which will compute the LinearRegression, UpperChannel and LowerChannel lines, the intercept and slope</p>
                        
<p>The Regression Channel indicator extends the <see cref="T:QuantConnect.Indicators.LeastSquaresMovingAverage" /> with the inclusion of two (upper and lower) channel lines that are distanced from the linear regression line by a user defined number of standard deviations.
