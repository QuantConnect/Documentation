Alpha models are intended to be easy to create and the primary location for iterating your strategy. To create Alpha Models, you must implement the $[IAlphaModel,T:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Alphas.IAlphaModel] interface as shown in the examples below. This has two methods:
</p>
<p>1. $[Update(),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Alphas.AlphaModel.Update] - Generate Insight objects.<br>2. $[OnSecuritiesChanged(),M:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Alphas.AlphaModel.OnSecuritiesChanged] - Receive notifications about security changes.

         // Generate insights on the securities in universe.
    }

class MyAlphaModel:

    def Update(self, algorithm, slice):
         # Updates this alpha model with the latest data from the algorithm.
         # This is called each time the algorithm receives data for subscribed securities
         # Generate insights on the securities in the universe.
         insights = []
         return insights

    def OnSecuritiesChanged(self, algorithm, changes):
         # Handle security changes in from your universe model.</pre>
</div>
<p>
You can access all the normal QCAlgorithm messages such as <code>Log</code>, and <code>Debug</code> from the algorithm object; for example logging is located at <code>algorithm.Log("message")</code>. The <code>slice</code> parameter contains the latest data available to the algorithm.
