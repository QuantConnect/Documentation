<p>
Symbols have several public properties you can use to identify the asset uniquely. When serialized together, this class allows the unique identification of millions of different security objects all within a self-contained reference.

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="all">
Symbol.Market            # Market USA, GDAX, Bitfinex, Oanda. Liquidity venues.
Symbol.SecurityType      # Security Types include Equity, Option, Future, Forex, Crypto and Cfd.
Symbol.OptionType        # American or European Option.
Symbol.OptionRight       # OptionRight indicates if a Put or Call.
Symbol.Date              # Earliest listing date if equities, expiry for future/option.
Symbol.HasUnderlying     # Is a derivative asset with another underlying asset.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
All of this data is encoded into the symbol object. QuantConnect does our best to hide the details of this from your algorithm, but occasionally you'll see it come through as an encoded hash like this: <code>AAPL R735QTJ8XC9X</code>. The first half of the encoded string represents the <b>first</b> ticker AAPL was listed under, the other letters at the end of the string represent other information for the asset (Security Type, Date Listed, Expiry Date, Strike Price, and Listed Market).

<h4>
Important: Adding Securities
</h4>
<p>
When you manually request data with <code>AddSecurity()/AddEquity()</code> methods, QuantConnect assumes you are adding the ticker as of <i>"today"</i> and automatically looks up the first ticker that an asset was listed with. Using the Google example above:
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
self.goog = self.AddEquity("GOOG").Symbol
self.Debug(self.goog.ID) # Prints "GOOCV VP83T1ZUHROL"
self.Debug(self.goog)    # Prints Your Reference "GOOG"
</pre>
<pre class="csharp">
var goog = AddEquity("GOOG").Symbol;
Debug(goog.ID.ToString()); // Prints "GOOCV VP83T1ZUHROL"
Debug(goog);               // Prints Your Reference "GOOG"
</pre>
</div>
<p>To access your reference value for a Symbol, you can use the <code>Symbol.Value</code> property which returns the string ticker you used to add the data to your algorithm (i.e. "GOOG" in our example).</p>
