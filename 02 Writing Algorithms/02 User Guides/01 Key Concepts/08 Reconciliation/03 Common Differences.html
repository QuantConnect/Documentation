<h4>Data Resolution Incompatibility</h4>
<p>
Using the correct data resolution is essential. Specifically, algorithms that have events scheduled intra-day, using the Scheduled Events API or by other means, need to use minute resolution data. Using the wrong data resolution can lead to stale prices and order fills, corrupting the signals and the results they produce.
</p>

<h4>Universe Selection</h4>
<p>In backtesting, universe selection happens at midnight Eastern Standard Time (EST). In live trading, it occurs when market data is processed, which can occur anytime between 05:00 to 08:00 EST. This can be problematic if events are scheduled to happen before or during the time window when universe selection happens in live trading.
</p>

<h4>External Data Sources</h4>
<p>
Each day, a backtest is run to generate the out-of-sample curve. If an algorithm relies on an external data source, exceptional care must be used when coding. External data can be changed, stop being available, or received at a different time in live trading than in backtesting. The&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 16px;">out-of-sample&nbsp;</span>backtest might not be able to fetch the same data at the same time or frequency that it is received in live trading. This can corrupt signals, lead to stale data and order placement, or otherwise adversely affect performance in some other manner, leading to differences in&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 16px;">out-of-sample&nbsp;</span>and live trading curves.
</p>

<h4>Existing Portfolio Securities</h4>
<p>
When an algorithm is deployed to a live brokerage account, it will accommodate any current positions that are open, even those unrelated to the algorithm itself. In backtesting, an empty portfolio is assumed. These pre-existing live positions aren't currently reflected in our reconciliation technology, and if they contribute to the live performance of your total portfolio, differences will inevitably exist between the&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 16px;">out-of-sample&nbsp;</span>and live curves.
</p>

<h4>Using the Time Property</h4>
<p>
In backtesting, time is a discrete process. Time intervals are rounded and time-steps are done in precise intervals. When trading live, however, time is a constant stream. Data streams in real-time and the algorithm events might happen milliseconds before or after the same events in backtesting. You cannot write statements like "if time is 11.00", as time will never <i>perfectly</i> equal 11am. You would need to say "if time &gt; 11.00 and &lt; 11.01".
</p>

<h4>Order Fill Differences</h4>
<p>In live trading, Market Orders are executed at whatever price the brokerage fills the order at. Backtesting, however, does not know what price live orders were filled at and instead models order fills based on the best price available according to backtest data.</p>
<p>
Similarly, Limit Order fills can differ between out-of-sample backtesting and live trading. In backtesting, Limit Orders are filled as soon as the limit price is hit. Brokerages, however, might fill the same Limit Order at a different price, or fail to fill it, depending on where the order is in the order book.
