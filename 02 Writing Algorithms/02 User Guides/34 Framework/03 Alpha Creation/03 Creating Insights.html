The Update method returns an array of Insight objects. An Insight is a <i>single</i> prediction for an asset. These can be thought of as actionable trading signals, indicating the asset direction, magnitude, and confidence in the near future. All insights can take a weight parameter to set the desired weighting for the insight. Insight classes have the following important properties:
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">class Insight {
    // Symbol of this Insight
    Symbol Symbol;

    // Gets the type of insight, for example, price insight or volatility insight
    InsightType Type;

    // Gets the predicted direction, Down, Flat or Up.
    InsightDirection Direction;

    // Gets the period over which this insight is expected to come to fruition
    TimeSpan Period;

    // Gets the predicted percent change in the insight type (price/volatility) (optional)
    double? Magnitude;

    // Gets the confidence in this insight (optional)
    double? Confidence;

    // The weight in this insight (optional)
    double? Weight;
}</pre>
	<pre class="python">class Insight:
    self.Symbol # Symbol of this Insight
    self.Type # Type of insight (price or volatility)
    self.Direction # Insight Direction (down, flat or up)
    self.Period # Insight period (TimeSpan)
    self.Magnitude # Expected percent change (optional, double)
    self.Confidence # Confidence in insight (optional, double)
    self.Weight # Weighting of the insight (optional, double) 
</pre>
</div>
<p>An $[Insight,T:QuantConnect.Algorithm.Framework.Alphas.Insight] constructor takes the following arguments:</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="python"># Insight Constructor Arguments:
# Insight(symbol, timedelta, type, direction, magnitude=None, confidence=None, sourceModel=None)
 Insight("IBM", timedelta(minutes=20), InsightType.Price, InsightDirection.Up, 0.0025, 1.00, None, 0.1)</pre>
	<pre class="csharp">// Insight Constructor Arguments
// new Insight(symbol, period, type, confidence=null, magnitude=null, source=null, weighting=null);
var insight = new Insight("IBM", TimeSpan.FromMinutes(20), InsightType.Price, InsightDirection.Up, null, weight:0.1);</pre>
</div>

	<p>We have provided a helper method to make creating Insights easier. This can be used in your Update method to create insight objects for your Alpha Model of the Price type:</p>  
	<div class="section-example-container">
		<pre class="python">insight = Insight.Price("IBM", timedelta(minutes = 20), InsightDirection.Up)</pre>
		<pre class="csharp">var insight = Insight.Price("IBM", TimeSpan.FromMinutes(20), InsightDirection.Up);</pre>
	</div>

	<p>If you are creating a portfolio style of algorithm where the Insights can recommend a specific weighting, you can specify the "Weight" property, which most portfolio construction systems will allocate capital to accordingly.</p>  
	<div class="section-example-container">
		<pre class="python"># Skipping magnitude, confidence and source model and assigning 25% to weighting.
insight = Insight.Price("IBM", timedelta(minutes = 20), InsightDirection.Up, None, None, None, 0.25)</pre>
		<pre class="csharp">// Skipping magnitude, confidence and source model and assigning 25% to weighting.
var insight = Insight.Price("IBM", TimeSpan.FromMinutes(20), InsightDirection.Up, null, null, null, 0.25);</pre>
	</div>
