Consolidating data allows you to create bars of any length from smaller bars. Commonly this is used to combine one-minute price bars into longer bars such as 10-20 minute bars. Using the price movement over a longer period can sometimes reduce the noise of the markets to make trading more efficient.

To achieve this, QuantConnect allows you to create <code>Consolidator</code> objects and register them for data. Using a consolidator makes creating longer periods easier and reduces the chance of bugs. In the following sections, we will introduce the different types of consolidators and show you how to shape data into any form.
