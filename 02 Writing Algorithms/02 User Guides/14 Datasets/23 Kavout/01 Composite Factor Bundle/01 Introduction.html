Kavout signals are machine-learning enhanced scores that capture the returns of systematic factors such as quality, value, momentum, growth, and low volatility. There are many different anomalies discovered by researchers and practitioners across these factor categories, and there is no good common definition of each style across the literature. Kavout creates an ensemble score for each style that gauges the different factors considered in the literature and industry practice.

In this data set, you will find Kavout proprietary signals for quality, value, momentum, growth, and low volatility, which have been adopted by some of the multi-billion dollar quant funds in New York and London. Each signal is generated by an ensemble model consisting of inputs from hundreds of anomalies. The data is generated on a daily basis and covers all the stocks traded in US major markets such as NYSE and Nasdaq since 2003. You could leverage this abundant set of signals to construct and backtest your strategies.
