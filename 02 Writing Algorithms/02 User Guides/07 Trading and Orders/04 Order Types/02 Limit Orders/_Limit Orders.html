<p>
Limit orders fill once the asset price is equal or better than the configured price. When purchasing an asset, this means the price 
  is equal or lower to the price you set. Conversely, when selling shares, this is when the price is equal or higher to the price you set. Limit orders are often used to get a good entry price, or take-profit on an existing holding.

Limit orders can be updated via their $[OrderTicket, T:QuantConnect.Orders.OrderTicket] because their orders are not immediately
  filled. For more information about updating orders, see <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Updating-Orders">Updating Orders</a>.
