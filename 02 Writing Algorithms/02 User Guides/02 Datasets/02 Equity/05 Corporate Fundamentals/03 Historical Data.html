<p>Historical corporate data can be accessed in the research environment using the <code>GetFundamental</code> method. In the following snippet, the daily PE ratio for Apple is gathered from January 1, 2020 to today. For some quarterly or yearly reported fundamentals like <code>FinancialStatements</code> and <code>OperationRatios</code>, you need to specify a period. For example, <code>EarningReports.BasicAverageShares.TwelveMonths</code> returns the one year value of the basic average shares, while <code>EarningReports.BasicAverageShares.ThreeMonths</code> provides the three month value. However, since the following snippet uses the PE ratio, a period doesn’t need to be selected.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">qb = QuantBook()
aapl = qb.AddEquity("AAPL").Symbol
pe_history = qb.GetFundamental(aapl, 
                               "ValuationRatios.PERatio", 
                               datetime(2020, 1, 1), 
                               datetime.now())
</pre>
