<p>This is the price scaling mode to use. For continuous futures, the following data normalization modes could be accepted:</p>
<table class="table qc-table table-dense table-striped"><tr><td><b>Data Normalization Mode</b></td><td><b>Definition</b></td></tr><tr><td>DataNormalizationMode.Raw</td><td>The raw price.</td></tr><tr><td>DataNormalizationMode.ForwardPanamaCanal</td><td>Eliminates price jumps between two consecutive contracts, adding a factor based on the difference of their prices.
<br /><br />The first contract has the true price.</td></tr><tr><td>DataNormalizationMode.BackwardsPanamaCanal</td><td>Eliminates price jumps between two consecutive contracts, adding a factor based on the difference of their prices.<br /><br />The last contract has the true price.</td></tr><tr><td>DataNormalizationMode.BackwardsRatio</td><td>Eliminates price jumps between two consecutive contracts, multiplying the prices by their ratio.<br /><br />The last contract has the true price.</td></tr></table><p>If any other data normalization mode is used, it will be converted to <i>DataNormalizationMode.BackwardsRatio</i> automatically.</p>
<br /><p>Example on how to use:</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">
self.continuous_contract = self.AddFuture(Futures.Energies.CrudeOilWTI,
                                          dataNormalizationMode = DataNormalizationMode.BackwardsRatio,
                                          dataMappingMode = DataMappingMode.OpenInterest,
                                          contractDepthOffset = 0)
</pre>
