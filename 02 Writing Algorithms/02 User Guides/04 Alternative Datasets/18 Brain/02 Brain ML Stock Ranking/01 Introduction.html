Brain ML Stock Ranking by Brain generates a daily ranking for US Equities based on their predicted ranking of future returns relative to the universe median across four-time horizons: next 2, 3, 5, 10, and 21 days (one trading month). The data covers 1,000 US Equities (universe updated yearly by including the largest 1,000 US companies of the previous year) starting in January 2010 and is delivered on a daily frequency. This dataset is created by a voting scheme of machine learning classifiers that non-linearly combine a variety of features with a series of techniques aimed at mitigating the well-known overfitting problem for financial data with a low signal-to-noise ratio. Examples of features are time-varying stock-specific features like price and volume-related metrics or fundamentals; time-fixed stock-specific features like the sector and other database information; market regime features such as volatility and other financial stress indicators; calendar features representing possible anomalies, for example, the month of the year.

More precisely the ML Stock Ranking score is related to the confidence of a Machine Learning classifier in predicting top or bottom quintile returns for the next N trading days (e.g. next 21 days) for a stock with the respect to the median of the universe and ranges from -1 to +1.

A negative score means that the system is more confident that the stock belongs to the lower returns quintile, a positive score means that the system is more confident that the stock belongs to the higher returns quintile. It is important to note that the score has a meaning only if used to compare different stocks to perform a ranking.

Typical use is to download the score for a large stock universe for a given day, e.g. 500 stocks or the full universe of 1000 stocks, order the stocks by mlAlpha score and go long the top K stocks, or build a long-short strategy going long the top K and short the bottom K stocks.
