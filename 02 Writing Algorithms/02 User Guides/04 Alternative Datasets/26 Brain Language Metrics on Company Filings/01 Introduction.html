<p>Brain Company Filings NLP monitors several language metrics on 10-K and 10-Q company reports for US Equities. The data covers 5,000 US Equities, starting in January 2010, and is delivered on a daily frequency. The dataset is made of two parts; the first one includes the language metrics of the most recent 10-K or 10-Q report for each firm, namely:</p>
<ol><li>Financial sentiment</li>
<li>Percentage of words belonging to financial domain classified by language types (e.g. “litigious” or “constraining” language)</li>
<li>Readability score</li>
<li>Lexical metrics such as lexical density and richness</li>
<li>Text statistics such as the report length and the average sentence length</li>
</ol><p>The second part includes the differences between the two most recent 10-Ks or 10-Qs reports of the same period for each company, namely:</p>
<ol><li>Difference of the various language metrics (e.g. delta sentiment, delta readability score, delta percentage of a specific language type etc.)</li>
<li>Similarity metrics between documents, also with respect to a specific language type (for example similarity with respect to “litigious” language or “uncertainty” language)</li>
</ol><p>The analysis is available for the whole report and for specific sections of the report (e.g. Risk Factors and MD&amp;A).</p>
