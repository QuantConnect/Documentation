<p>This indicator computes the Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA). The Double Exponential Moving Average is calculated with the following formula: EMA2 = EMA(EMA(t,period),period) DEMA = 2 * EMA(t,period) - EMA2 The Generalized DEMA (GD) is calculated with the following formula: GD = (volumeFactor+1) * EMA(t,period) - volumeFactor * EMA2</p>
