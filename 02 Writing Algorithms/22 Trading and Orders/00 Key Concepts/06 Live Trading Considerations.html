<p>In live trading, orders fill asynchronously. We send your order to the API of your brokerage and wait for their response to update the state of your algorithm and portfolio. When your order fills, the fill price is set by your brokerage. You can add event handlers to your algorithm to <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages#07-Monitor-the-Brokerage-Connection">monitor the brokerage connection</a> and <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages#08-Monitor-Brokerage-Messages">brokerage messages</a>.</p>
