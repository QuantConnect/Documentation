<p>
We provide dozens of methods to create, update, and cancel orders. You can place orders <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Automatic-Position-Sizing-SetHoldings">automatically</a> with helper methods or manually through methods on the algorithm API. You can <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Updating-Orders">fetch, update, and cancel</a> manual orders with Order Tickets.  As orders are filled and updated, they generate <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Tracking-Order-Events">events</a> that notify your algorithm about their execution.

<p>In backtesting, order fills are simulated using historical data, but you can create your own fill, fee, slippage, and margin models via plugin points. You control how optimistic or pessimistic order fills are with <a href="#Trading-and-Orders-Slippage-Transaction-and-Brokerage-Models">transaction model</a> classes. In live trading, the fill price is set by your brokerage when the order is filled.</p>
