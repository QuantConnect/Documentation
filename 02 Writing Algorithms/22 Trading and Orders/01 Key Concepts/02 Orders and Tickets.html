<p>When you create an order with one of the order methods, LEAN creates <code>Order</code> and <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-management/order-tickets">OrderTicket</a> objects. The order ticket is sent to your brokerage. As the brokerage processes your order, it returns another order ticket and it's compared against the order to see if the order is satisfied. Orders are asynchronous in live trading, so if you want to change an order, you must request it with the order ticket. Order changes are not guaranteed since your order may fill by the time brokerage receives the request.</p>
