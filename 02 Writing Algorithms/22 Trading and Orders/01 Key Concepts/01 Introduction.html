<p>LEAN has dozens of methods to create, update, and cancel orders. You can place orders automatically with <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/position-sizing'>helper methods</a> or manually through methods on the algorithm API. You can fetch, update, and cancel manual orders with <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-management/order-tickets'>order tickets</a>. As the state of your orders change, LEAN creates <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-events">events</a> that notify your algorithm.</p>

<p>In backtesting, LEAN simulates order fills with historical data, but you can create your own fill, fee, slippage, and margin models via plugin points. You control how optimistic or pessimistic order fills are with transaction model classes. For more information about these types of models, see <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/key-concepts'>Reality Modeling</a>.</p>
