<p>If you use the <code>Liquidate</code> method to liquidate a Crypto position, it only liquidates the quantity of the virtual pair. Since the virtual pair BTCUSD may not represent all of your BTC holdings, don't use the <code>Liquidate</code> method to liquidate Crypto positions. Instead, calculate the order quantity based on the currency amounts in your cash book and place manual orders. The following code snippet demonstrates how to liquidate a BTCUSD position.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp"></pre>
<pre class="python">quantity = ...
self.MarketOrder("BTCUSD", quantity)</pre>
</div>
