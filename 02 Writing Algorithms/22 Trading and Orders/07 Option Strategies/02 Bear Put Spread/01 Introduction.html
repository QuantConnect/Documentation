<p><span class="new-term">Bear put spread</span>, which is also known as <span class="new-term">short put spread</span>, consists of buying an ITM put and selling an OTM put. Both puts have the same underlying stock and the same expiration date. The OTM put serve as a hedge of the ITM put. It is a option strategy profitting from a decline in underlying asset price.</p>
<p>This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is as follows:</p>
$Payoff_{OTM\ put}=(Strike_{OTM\ put}-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{ITM\ put}=(Strike_{ITM\ put}-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Profit/Loss=(Payoff_{ITM\ put}-Payoff_{OTM\ put}+credit\ received_{OTM\ put}-debit\ paid_{ITM\ put})\times multiplier-commissions$

<p>The maximum profit is the spread between the 2 options' strike prices minus net debit paid when opening the trade. If the price is declined and lower than the strike prices of both puts, they will worth <span class="latex-variable">$(strike - underlying price)</span> at expiration.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is the net debit paid after commission when opening the trade, where is underlying price is above both strike prices and the options become worthless.</p>
<p>If the option is American option, there will be a risk of early assignment on the shorted option.</p>
