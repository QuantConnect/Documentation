 A Butterfly Spread consists of three legs with a total of four options. In this tutorial, we use the Long Butterfly Spread as an example: long one ITM call, short two ATM calls and long one OTM call. All the calls have the same expiration. On the other hand, the middle strike is halfway between the lower and the higher strikes.

	The aim of a Butterfly Spread strategy is for a trader to profit from marginal price changes in the underlying stock in either direction.
