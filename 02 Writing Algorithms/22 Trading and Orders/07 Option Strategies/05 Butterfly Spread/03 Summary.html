	From the following algorithm, at time 0, the GOOG share price is $832.8. We purchase 1 OTM call option with strike price $855, 1 ITM call option with strike price $810 and sell 2 ATM options with strike prices at 835. At the expiry 05/19/2017, the share price is $930 and so the long positions of the ITM option and the OTM option are exercised: we buy 100 GOOG shares at $810 and buy another 100 shares at $855. At the same time, the 2 short positions of the ATM option are also exercised: we sell 200  GOOG shares to the option holder at $835. After the expiration date, we don't hold any shares of the underlying. Since the stock price had a sharp increase during the life of options, we fail to profit from a Long Call Butterfly Spread.
