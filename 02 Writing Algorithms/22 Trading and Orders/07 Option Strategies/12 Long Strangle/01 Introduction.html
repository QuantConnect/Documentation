<p><span class="new-term">Long Strangle</span> is an options trading strategy involving simultaneous buying of an OTM put and an OTM call, where both options have the same underlying asset and expiration date. This strategy aims to profit from volatile movements in the underlying stock, either positive or negative.</p>
<p>Compare to a long straddle, the net debit is lower since OTM options are cheaper, but this also widen the losing range and the strike spread is widen.</p>
<p>The payoff is as follows:</p>
$Payoff_{call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike)^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{put}=(Strike-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Profit/Loss=(Payoff_{call}+Payoff_{put}-debit\ paid_{call}-debit\ paid_{put})\times multiplier-commissions$
<br><br>

<p>The maximum profit is unlimited, if the underlying price is risen to infinity at expiration.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is the net debit paid when opening the trade, where is underlying price is unchanged and both options become worthless.</p>
