A <span class="new-term">Protective Collar</span> is an options strategy that involves the combination a <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/option-strategies/covered-call">Covered Call</a> and a long put (protective put), with a lower strike price than the shorted call. This could provide additional protection to limit the drawdown when the underlying price drop too deep when compared to the covered call.
</p>
<p>
This is a limited-profit-limited-loss strategy. The payoff is as follows:
</p>
$Payoff_{call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{call})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{put}=(Strike_{put}-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$$Payoff=(Price^{T=expiry}_{underlying}-Price^{T=trade\ open}_{underlying}-Payoff_{call}+Payoff_{put}\\
+credit\ received_{call}-debit\ paid_{put})\times multiplier-commissions$$
<br><br>

<p>The maximum profit is the call strike minus underlying price, plus the net premium (or minus the net debit paid) of option trades after commission when opening the trade, where the underlying price has price the same as or above the strike price of the call at expiration.</p>
