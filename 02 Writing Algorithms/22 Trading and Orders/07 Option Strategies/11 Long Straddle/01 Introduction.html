<p><span class="new-term">Long Straddle</span> is an options trading strategy involving the going long in both an ATM call and an ATM put option, where both options have the same underlying asset, strike price and expiration date. This strategy aims to profit from volatile movements in the underlying stock, either positive or negative.</p>
<p>The payoff is as follows:</p>
$Payoff_{call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike)^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{put}=(Strike-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Profit/Loss=(Payoff_{call}+Payoff_{put}-debit\ paid_{call}-debit\ paid_{put})\times multiplier-commissions$
<br><br>

<p>The maximum profit is unlimited, if the underlying price is risen to infinity at expiration.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is the net debit paid when opening the trade, where is underlying price is unchanged and both options become worthless.</p>
