<h4>Long Iron Butterfly</h4>
<p>It consists of selling an OTM call, selling an OTM put, buying an ATM call and buying an ATM put. It is a option strategy profitting from an decrease in price movement (implied volatility).</p>
<p>This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is as follows:</p>
$Payoff_{far\ OTM\ call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{far\ OTM\ call})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{near\ OTM\ call}=(Price_{underlying}-Strike_{near\ OTM\ call})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{far\ OTM\ put}=(Strike_{far\ OTM\ put}-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Payoff_{near\ OTM\ put}=(Strike_{near\ OTM\ put}-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$$Profit/Loss=(Payoff_{near\ OTM\ call}+Payoff_{near\ OTM\ put}-Payoff_{far\ OTM\ call}-Payoff_{far\ OTM\ put}\\
\quad+credit\ received_{far\ OTM\ call}+credit\ received_{far\ OTM\ put}-debit\ paid_{near\ OTM\ call}-debit\ paid_{near\ OTM\ put})\\
\quad\times multiplier-commissions$$

<p>The maximum profit is $Strike_{far\ OTM\ call}-Strike_{near\ OTM\ call}$ minus net debit paid when opening the trade, where the underlying price fell below the OTM put strike or above the OTM call strike price at expiration.</p>
<p>Maximum loss is the net debit paid after commission when opening the trade, where $Strike_{near\ OTM\ put} < underlying price < Strike_{near\ OTM\ call}$.</p>
<p>If the option is American option, there will be a risk of early assignment on the shorted option.</p>

<h4>Short Call Butterfly</h4>
<p>It consists of buying an OTM call, buying an OTM put, selling an ATM call and selling an ATM put. It is a option strategy profitting from an increase in price movement (implied volatility), as well as time decay value since ATM options decay sharper.</p>
<p>This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is as follows:</p>
$$Profit/Loss=(Payoff_{OTM\ call}+Payoff_{OTM\ put}-Payoff_{ATM\ call}-Payoff_{ATM\ put}\\
\quad+credit\ received_{ATM\ call}+credit\ received_{ATM\ put}-debit\ paid_{OTM\ call}-debit\ paid_{OTM\ put})\\
\quad\times multiplier-commissions$$
