<p><span class="new-term">Bull call spread</span>, also known as <span class="new-term">long call spread</span>, consists of buying an ITM call and selling an OTM call. Both calls have the same underlying Equity and the same expiration date. The OTM call serves as a hedge for the ITM call. The bull call spread profits from a rise in underlying asset price.</p>
<p>The bull call spread is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy. The payoff is</p>

<p>The following chart shows the payoff at expiration:</p>

<p>The maximum profit is $K^{OTM} - K^{ITM} + C^{OTM}_0 - C^{ITM}_0$. If the underlying price increases to exceed both strikes at expiration, both calls are worth $(S_T - K)$ at expiration.</p>
<p>The maximum loss is the net debit you paid to open the position, $C^{OTM}_0 - C^{ITM}_0$.</p>
<p>If the Option is American Option, there is a risk of early assignment on the sold contract.</p>
