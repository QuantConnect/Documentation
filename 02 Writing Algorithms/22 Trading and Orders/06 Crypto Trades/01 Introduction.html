<p>All fiat and Crypto currencies are individual assets. When you buy a pair like BTCUSD, you trade USD for BTC. In this case, LEAN removes some USD from your portfolio cash book and adds some BTC. The virtual pair BTCUSD represents your position in the trade, but the virtual pair doesn't actually exist. It simply represents an open trade.</p>
