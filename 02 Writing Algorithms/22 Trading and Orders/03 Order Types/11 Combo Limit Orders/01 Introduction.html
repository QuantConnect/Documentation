<p>Combo limit orders are individual orders that contain <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/limit-orders'>limit orders</a> for muliple securities. Combo limit orders are different from <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/combo-leg-limit-orders'>combo leg limit orders</a> because you must set the limit price of all the leg orders to be the same with combo limit orders. With combo leg limit orders, you can create the order without forcing each leg to have the same limit price. Combo limit orders currently only work for trading Option contracts and their underlying Equities.</p>
