<p>Limit orders are instructions to trade a quantity of an asset at a specific price or a better price. A <span class="new-term">marketable limit order</span> has a limit price that crosses the spread. An <span class="new-term">unmarketable limit order</span> has a limit price that doesn't cross the spread. For example, if an asset has an ask price of $100 and you place a limit order to buy at $100 or higher, that's a marketable limit order that should immediately fill. If you place a limit order to buy at $99.99 or lower, that's an unmarketable limit order that should go on the order book. Unmarketable limit orders save you from paying spread costs. Some brokerages even charge you a lower transaction fee if you use 
unmarketable limit orders rather than marketable limit orders.</p>

<p>Limit orders are helpful in illiquid markets. You can use them to get a good entry price or to set a take-profit level on an existing holding. However, if the market trades away from your limit price, you may have to adjust your limit price or wait for the market to trade back to your limit price to fill the order.</p>
