<p>Market orders are instructions to trade a specific number of units, regardless of the fill price. If your highest priority is to fill an order as fast as possible, use market orders. If the order book of the security you're trading has sufficient liquidity when the brokerage receives your order, it immediately fills. However, if there is not enough liquidity by the brokerage, you get partial fills and may incur additional costs from market impact.</p>
