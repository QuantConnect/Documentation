<p>A trailing stop loss order is a dynamic stop loss that moves towards the asset price as the asset trades away from the stop price. For example, if you set a trailing stop loss to 10%, the furthest away it will ever be from the asset price is 10%. If it's a sell trailing stop loss order that's below the asset price and the asset price increases such that the trailing stop is more than 10% away, the trailing stop loss moves up to be 10% below the asset price. If the asset price decreases, the trailing stop loss doesn't move.</p>
