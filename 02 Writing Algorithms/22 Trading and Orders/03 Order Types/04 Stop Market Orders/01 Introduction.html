<p>Stop market orders fill as a market order when the asset reaches a specific price. A buy stop market order triggers when the asset price is greater than or equal to the stop price. A sell stop market order triggers when the asset price is less than or equal to the stop price. You can use stop market orders to buy breakouts or to mitigate the risk of large losses. However, if the market gaps past your stop price, the order may fill at a worse price than the stop price you set. There is no guarantee that a stop market order fills at the stop price.</p>
