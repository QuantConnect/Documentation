<p>Stop limit orders are instructions to place a limit order once an asset passes a specific price level. They are similar to <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/stop-market-orders">stop market orders</a>, but use <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/limit-orders">limit orders</a> instead of <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/market-orders">market orders</a> to give you more control over the fill price. A buy stop limit order has a stop price above the current market price and a sell stop limit order has a stop price below the current market price. In effect, they are the opposite of <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-types/limit-if-touched-orders">limit if touched orders</a>.<br></p>
