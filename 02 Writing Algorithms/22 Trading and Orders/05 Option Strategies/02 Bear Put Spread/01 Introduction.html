<p><span class="new-term">Bear put spread</span>, which is also known as <span class="new-term">short put spread</span>, consists of buying an ITM put and selling an OTM put. Both puts have the same underlying stock and the same expiration date. The OTM put serve as a hedge of the ITM put.</p>
<p>It is a option strategy profitting from a decline in underlying asset price. This is a limited-reward-limited-risk strategy.</p>

$Payout_{OTM\ put}=(Strike_{OTM\ put}-Price_{underlying})^{+}$

$Payout_{ITM\ put}=(Strike_{ITM\ put}-Price_{underlying})^{+}$
<br><br>
$Profit/Loss=(Payout_{ITM\ put}-Payout_{OTM\ put}+credit\ received_{OTM\ put}-debit\ paid_{ITM\ put})\times multiplier-commissions$
