<p>If you buy an Option contract, you can exercise your right to buy or sell the underlying shares at the strike price. However, you don't need to exercise it. You can sell the Option or let it expire worthless if it's out of the money. If you hold
 a long position in an Option that expires in the money, LEAN automatically exercises it at the expiration date. If you sell an Option contract and the buyer exercises their right to buy or sell the underlying shares, you are assigned the Option and must trade with the buyer at the strike price.</p>
