<p>The algorithm transactions manager (<code>SecurityTransactionManager</code>) contains a collection of helper methods to quickly access all your orders. To access the transaction manager, use the the <code>Transactions</code> property of your algorithm. If you save a reference to your <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/order-management/order-tickets'>order tickets</a>, you shouldn't need to use the transaction manager. LEAN updates the order tickets as the brokerage processes your orders.</p>
