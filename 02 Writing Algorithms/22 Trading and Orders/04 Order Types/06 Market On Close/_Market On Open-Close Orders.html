Market On Close orders are filled at the official <i>closing</i> price for the security. They must be submitted at least two minutes before the market closes to be included in the official closing auction. The Market On Open <code>Quantity</code> and <code>Tag</code> properties can be updated after creation until the last two minutes before close.

<h4>Fill Price Considerations</h4>
<p>
When you place a market on open or close order, you do not know its fill price until after the order is completed. If your order quantity is too close to your total portfolio buying power, you have a high chance of it being rejected as there may be large changes in price overnight. We recommend you consider this when sizing your portfolio to increase your probability of successful trades.
