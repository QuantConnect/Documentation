<pre class="csharp">// Buy 10 shares of SPY at the market open
var ticket = MarketOnOpenOrder("SPY", 10);

- You won't know the order fill price until after the order is completed. If your order quantity is too close to your total portfolio buying power, you have a high chance of it being rejected as there may be large changes in price overnight. Consider this when sizing your portfolio to increase your probability of successful trades.
<br>- Not guaranteed to fill if the auction is heavily skewed to one side of the order book
