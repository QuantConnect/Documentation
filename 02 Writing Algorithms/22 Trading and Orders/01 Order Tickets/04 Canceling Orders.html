To cancel an order, you must use its $[OrderTicket, T:QuantConnect.Orders.OrderTicket]. Market Orders are transmitted to the brokerage immediately and cannot be canceled. The <code>Cancel()</code> method returns an $[OrderResponse, T:QuantConnect.Orders.OrderResponse] object to determine if the operation was successful.

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Create an order and save its ticket
var ticket = LimitOrder("SPY", 100, 221.05, tag: "SPY Trade to Cancel");

//Later cancel the order via the order ticket.
var response = ticket.Cancel();

// Use order response object to read status
if (response.IsSuccessful) {
       Debug("Order successfully canceled");
}
</pre>
<pre class="python"> # Create an order and save its ticket
ticket = self.LimitOrder("SPY", 100, 221.05, False, "SPY Trade to Cancel")

# Tag order later
response = ticket.Cancel("Canceled SPY Trade")

# Use order response object to read status
if response.IsSuccessful:
     self.Debug("Order successfully canceled")

To get the CancelOrderRequest, call the CancelRequest method. It gets the CancelOrderRequest if the order was cancelled. Otherwise, it returns null. <br></div><div>- You can also pass in a tag to the Cancel method.<br></div>
