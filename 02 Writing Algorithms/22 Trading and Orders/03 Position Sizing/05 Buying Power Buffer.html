<p>If you place a market on open order near the market close, the market can gap overnight to a worse open price. If the gap is large enough against you, you may not have sufficient buying power at the open to fill your trade. To ensure a high probability of order fills through market gaps and discontinuities, the <code>SetHoldings</code> method assumes a small built-in cash buffer. If LEAN rejects your orders due to buying power, widen the cash buffer through the algorithm <code>Settings</code> property. The default buffer is 2.5%.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">// Set the cash buffer to 5%
Settings.FreePortfolioValuePercentage = 0.05;

// Set the cash buffer to $10,000
Settings.FreePortfolioValue = 10000m;</pre>
<pre class="python"># Set the cash buffer to 5%
self.Settings.FreePortfolioValuePercentage = 0.05

# Set the cash buffer to $10,000
self.Settings.FreePortfolioValue = 10000</pre>
</div>

<p>If you use <code>FreePortfolioValuePercentage</code>, you must set it in the <code>Initialize</code> or <code>PostInitialize</code> event handler. If you use <code>FreePortfolioValue</code>, you must set it after the <code>PostInitialize</code> event handler.</p>
