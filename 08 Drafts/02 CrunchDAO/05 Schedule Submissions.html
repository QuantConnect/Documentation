<p>CrunchDAO provides a new skeleton every Saturday at 6 PM Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). To schedule your submissions for before the market opens each week, during initialization, you can create a <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/scheduled-events'>Scheduled Event</a>.</p>


<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">self.week = -1
self.Schedule.On(
    self.DateRules.Every([DayOfWeek.Monday, DayOfWeek.Tuesday, DayOfWeek.Wednesday, DayOfWeek.Thursday, DayOfWeek.Friday]), 
    self.TimeRules.At(13, 15, TimeZones.Utc), 
    self.submit_signals)</pre>
</div>

<p>The preceding Scheduled Event calls the <code>submit_signals</code> method every weekday at 1:15 PM UTC. Define this method to create and send portfolio targets to CrunchDAO.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="python">def submit_signals(self):
    if self.IsWarmingUp:
        return
    
    # Submit signals once per week
    week_num = self.Time.isocalendar()[1]
    if self.week == week_num:
        return
    self.week = week_num

    symbols = [security.Symbol for security in self.crunch_universe if security.Price > 0]

    # Get historical price data
    # close_prices = self.History(symbols, 22, Resolution.Daily).close.unstack(0)

    # Create portfolio targets
    weight_by_symbol = {symbol: 1/len(symbols) for symbol in symbols} # Add your logic here
    targets = [PortfolioTarget(symbol, weight) for symbol, weight in weight_by_symbol.items()]

    # (Optional) Place trades
    self.SetHoldings(targets)

    # Send signals to CrunchDAO
    success = self.SignalExport.SetTargetPortfolio(targets)
    if not success:
        self.Debug(f"Couldn't send targets at {self.Time}")</pre>
</div>
