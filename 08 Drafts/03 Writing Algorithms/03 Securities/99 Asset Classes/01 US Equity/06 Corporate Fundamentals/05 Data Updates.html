<p>The US Fundmamental dataset only provides the originally-reported figures. If there was a mistake in reporting a figure, the data value isn't fixed later. In live trading, new fundamental data is available to your algorithms at approximately 6 AM Eastern Time (ET) each day. The majority of the corporate data update occurs once per month, but the financial ratios update daily. If there is no new data for a period of time, the previous data is filled forward.</p>
