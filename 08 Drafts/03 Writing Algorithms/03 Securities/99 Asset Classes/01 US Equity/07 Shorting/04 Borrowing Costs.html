<p>In live trading, you usually pay a fee to borrow shares that you use to open a short position. Part of the fee goes to the investor that provided you with the opportunity to short with their shares. The borrowing rate is set by your live brokerage. In backtests, LEAN doesn't currently model borrowing costs, but we have an open GitHub Issue to add the functionality. Subscribe to <a rel='nofollow' target="_blank" href='https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues/4563'>GitHub Issue #4563</a> to track the feature progress.</p>
