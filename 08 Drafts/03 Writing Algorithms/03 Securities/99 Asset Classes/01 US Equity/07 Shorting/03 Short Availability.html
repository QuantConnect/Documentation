<p>To short sell, you need to borrow the shares from another investor or your brokerage. The <span class="new-term">short availability</span> is the number of shares available for you to borrow. If you don't model the short availability in backtests, you could have a strategy that performs well in backtesting but doesn't trade in live mode because the shares aren't available to borrow. If you assume your short orders are successful in backtests, your backtesting results likely won't represent the true performance of actually trading the strategy during the backtest period. To get the short availability in your algorithms, use the <a href="/datasets/us-equities-short-availability">US Equities Short Availability dataset</a>.
