<p>In a regular long position, you buy shares and then sell them later to close the trade. In a short position, you borrow shares, sell them, and then buy the shares back later to close the trade. Short positions let you profit when a security's price decreases while you have the position open, but there are risks involved. For example, you can get a margin call and you may incur borrowing costs.</p>
