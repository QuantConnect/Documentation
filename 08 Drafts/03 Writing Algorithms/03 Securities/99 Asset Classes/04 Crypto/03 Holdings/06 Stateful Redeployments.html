<p>When you make a trade inside of a running algorithm, LEAN tracks the virtual position state for you, but it won't survive between deployments. Some brokerages save your virtual pairs, so you can load them into your algorithm when you stop and redeploy it. Depending on the brokerage you select, you may be able to manually add virtual pairs when you deploy live algorithms with the <a href='/docs/v2/lean-cli/live-trading/brokerages/quantconnect-paper-trading'>LEAN CLI</a> or <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/deployment#05-Wizard'>cloud deployment wizard</a>.</p>
