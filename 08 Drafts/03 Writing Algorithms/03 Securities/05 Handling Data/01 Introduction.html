<p>LEAN packages the data for your <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/securities/requesting-data">subscriptions</a> in a <code>Slice</code> object and passes it to the <code>OnData</code> method of your algorithm. To avoid <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/key-concepts/glossary#17-look-ahead-bias'>look-ahead bias</a>, LEAN only provides the data that's available at the current time in your algorithm. This processing style ensures that your algorithm backtests in the same manner that it trades live. Your algorithm uses the data to make trading decisions and LEAN uses the data to update your positions, track your portfolio value, and simulate orders.</p>
