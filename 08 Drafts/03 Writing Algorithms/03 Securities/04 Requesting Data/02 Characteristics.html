<p>We thoroughly vet datasets before we add them to the Data Market. The datasets in the Data Market are well-defined with robust ticker and <code>Symbol</code> links to ensure tickers are properly tracked through time. The datasets are consistently delivered on time and most of them are ready for live trading. All the datasets have at least one year of historical data and are free of survivorship bias.</p>
