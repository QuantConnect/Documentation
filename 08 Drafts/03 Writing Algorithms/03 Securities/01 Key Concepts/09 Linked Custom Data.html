<p>Linked custom data is custom data that's linked to individual assets. In contrast, unlinked data is not linked to specific assets. An example of an unlinked dataset is the <a href="/datasets/regalytics-us-regulatory-alerts">US Regulatory Alerts</a> dataset. LEAN passes custom data objects to the <code>OnData</code> method. For more information about custom data, see <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/importing-data/streaming-data/custom-securities/key-concepts'>Custom Securities</a>.</p>
