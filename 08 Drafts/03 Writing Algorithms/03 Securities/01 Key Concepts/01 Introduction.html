<p>A security is an individual financial asset that you might trade on an exchange. LEAN models these unique assets with a <code>Security</code> object, which the <code>AddEquity</code>, <code>AddCrypto</code>, and similar methods return. The <code>Securities</code> property of the <code>QCAlgorithm</code> class is a dictionary where the keys are <code>Symbol</code> objects and the values are <code>Security</code> objects. The <code>Securities</code> dictionary contains all of the securities that have been in the algorithm during its lifetime. </p>
