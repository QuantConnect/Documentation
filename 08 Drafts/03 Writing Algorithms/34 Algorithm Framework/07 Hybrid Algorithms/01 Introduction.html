<p>Classic style algorithms can also use Algorithm Framework modules. This allows you to get the best of both styles of algorithm design, combining easily pluggable modules with the superior control of classic format.</p>

<p>Examples of popular use-cases of a hybrid approach are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using framework universe selection models as the assets to select.</li>
    <li>Using portfolio construction models to decide portfolio allocations.</li>
    <li>Using a risk control model for free portfolio risk monitoring.</li>
    <li>Passing data between modules freely without concerns of the module interface.</li>
</ul>
