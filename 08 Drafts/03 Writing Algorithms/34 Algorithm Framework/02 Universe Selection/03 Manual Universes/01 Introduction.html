<p>The <code>ManualUniverseSelectionModel</code> selects a static, fixed set of assets. It is similar to adding securities with the traditional <code>AddSecurity</code> API methods. If your algorithm has a static universe, you can use <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/automatic-indicators">automatic indicators</a> instead of <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/indicators/manual-indicators">manual indicators</a> in your algorithm.</p>

<p>Manual universes can be prone to <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/key-concepts/glossary#17-look-ahead-bias">look-ahead bias</a>. For example, if you select a set of securities that have performed well during the backtest period, you are incorporating information from the future into the backtest and the algorithm may underperform in live mode.<br></p>
