<p>The Algorithm Framework is built into the <code>QCAlgorithm</code> class, so your strategy can access all the normal methods you use for algorithm development. You should be able to copy and paste your algorithms across without any changes. You don't need a separate class.</p>

<p>The framework data output of each module flows into the following module. The assets that the Universe Selection model selects are fed into the Alpha model to generate trade signals (<code>Insight</code> objects). The <code>Insight</code> objects from the Alpha model are fed into the Portfolio Construction model to create <code>PortfolioTarget</code> objects, which contain the target number of units to hold for each asset. The <code>PortfolioTarget</code> objects from the Portfolio Construction model are fed into the Risk Management model to ensure the targets are within safe risk parameters and to adjust the <code>PortfolioTarget</code> objects if necessary. The <code>PortfolioTarget</code> objects from the Risk Management model are fed into the Execution model, which efficiently places trades to acquire the target portfolio.

<p>For simple strategies, it may seem like overkill to abstract out your algorithm concepts. However, even simple strategies can benefit from reusing the ecosystem of modules available in QuantConnect. Imagine pairing your EMA-cross Alpha model with a better execution system or plugging in an open-source <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/risk-management/supported-models#07-Trailing-Stop-Model">trailing stop Risk Management model</a>.</p>
