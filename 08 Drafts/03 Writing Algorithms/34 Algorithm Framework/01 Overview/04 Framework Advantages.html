<p>We recommend you design strategies with the Algorithm Framework in most cases. The Algorithm Framework has many advantages over the classic algorithm design.</p>

<h4>Pluggable Algorithm Modules</h4>
<p>With the Algorithm Framework, your code can instantly utilize all modules built within the framework. The modules clip together in well-defined ways, which enable them to be shared and swapped interchangeably. </p>

<h4>Focus On Your Strengths</h4>
<p>If you write code in modules, you can focus on your strengths. If you are great at building universes, you can build Universe Selection modules. If you have risk management experience, you could write reusable risk monitoring technology.</p>

<h4>Reduce Development By Using Community Modules</h4>
<p>Easily share modules you've made between algorithms or pull in ones produced by the community. The strict separation of duties makes the Algorithm Framework perfect for reusing code between strategies.</p>
