<p>Since QuantConnect was formed in 2013, the community has created more than 2 million algorithms. Although they all seek to achieve different results, they can all be abstracted into the same core features. The Algorithm Framework is our attempt to provide this well-defined structure to the community, encouraging good design and making your work more reusable. LEAN provides many pre-built Algorithm Framework models you can use in your algorithms.</p>
