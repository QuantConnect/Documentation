There are many creative ways to manage risk. Some examples of risk management include the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>"Trailing Stop Risk Management Model"</i><br> Create and manage trailing stop-loss orders for open positions.
</li>
	<li><i>"Option Hedging Risk Management Model"</i><br> Purchase options to hedge large equity exposures.
</li>
	<li><i>"Sector Exposure Risk Management Model"</i><br>Reduce position sizes when overexposed to sectors or individual assets, keeping the portfolio within diversification requirements.
</li>
	<li><i>"Flash Crash Detection Risk Management Model"</i><br>Scan for strange market situations that might be precursors to a flash crash and attempt to protect the portfolio when they are detected.
</li>
</ul>
