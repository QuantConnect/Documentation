<p>The <code>InsightManager</code> tracks all of the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/alpha/key-concepts#06-Insights'>Insight objects</a> in your algorithm. It's an <code>InsightCollection</code>, which stores all of your insights in an internal dictionary that has the security <code>Symbol</code> as the key and a list of <code>Insight</code> objects as the value. You can access the manager anywhere in your algorithm where you have reference to the algorithm class. If you want to use an <code>InsightCollection</code> in your algorithm that's seperate from the <code>InsightManager</code>, create a new <code>InsightCollection</code>.</p>
