<p>You can add multiple Alpha models to a single algorithm and generate Insight objects with all of them.
</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="csharp">AddAlpha(new RsiAlphaModel());
AddAlpha(new EmaCrossAlphaModel());</pre>
	<pre class="python">self.AddAlpha(RsiAlphaModel())
self.AddAlpha(EmaCrossAlphaModel())</pre>
</div>

<p>Each Alpha model has a unique name. The Insight objects they generate are automatically named according to the Alpha model name.</p>

<p>If you add multiple Alpha models, each alpha model receives the current slice in the order that you add the Alphas. The combined stream of Insight objects is passed to the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/portfolio-construction/key-concepts#04-Multi-Alpha-Algorithms">Portfolio Construction model</a> that defines how the Insight collection is combined. If you have a hybrid algorithm, the combined stream of Insight objects is passed to the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/hybrid-algorithms#03-Alpha">event handler</a>.</p>
