<p>This page describes the pre-built Alpha models in LEAN. The number of models grows over time. To add a model to LEAN, make a pull request to the <a rel='nofollow' target='_blank' href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/tree/master/Algorithm.Framework/Alphas">GitHub repository</a>. If none of these models perform exactly how you want, create a <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/algorithm-framework/alpha/key-concepts#04-Model-Structure'>custom Alpha model</a>.</p>
