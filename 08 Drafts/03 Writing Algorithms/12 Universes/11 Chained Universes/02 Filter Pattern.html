    Universes filter a large set of <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/key-concepts/security-identifiers">Symbol</a> objects by a coarse filter to quickly reduce the data processing requirement. This is often a first step before applying a second filter or requesting alternative data. For example, a strategy might only be interested in easily tradable liquid assets so quickly eliminates all stocks with less than $1M USD / day in trading volume.

<p>The order of your filters can improve the speed of your research. By applying filters that narrow the universe the most, or are the lightest weight first, you can significantly reduce the amount of data your algorithm processes. Unless necessary, you can also not return any selections from earlier filters to further improve research speed, keeping only the universe data for later filters. </p>
