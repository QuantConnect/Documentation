<p>You can combine ("chain") universes together to fetch fundamental and alternative data on a specific subset of assets. Universes filter input data and return <code>Symbol</code> objects. The only requirement is that <code>Symbol</code> objects the filter returns are a subset of the input data. The source of the <code>Symbol</code> objects is unrestricted, so you can feed the output of one universe into another.</p>
