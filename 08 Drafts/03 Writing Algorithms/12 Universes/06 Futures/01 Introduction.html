<p>A Futures universe lets you select a basket of contracts for a single Future. LEAN models Future subscriptions as a universe of Future contracts. A Future universe is similar to an <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/universes/equity-options'>Option universe</a>, except Future contracts don't have a strike price, so the universe filter primarily focuses on the contract expiration date.</p>
