<p>When you add a universe to your algorithm, LEAN sends a large dataset into a filter function you define. Your filter function needs to return a list of <code>Symbol</code> objects. LEAN automatically subscribes to these new symbols and adds them to your algorithm. Your algorithm can do almost anything inside your filter functions, but the goal should be to narrow down the set of securities to the securities that are most applicable for your algorithm.</p>
