QuantConnect has supported live trading since 2015. We have battle-tested, colocated servers that serve thousands of live trading clients. Algorithms demand fierce stability and uptime, and it is common for our users to achieve 6-months uptime with no interruptions. To achieve this, we purchased modern servers and racked them in Equinix to give the QuantConnect community the best possible stability.

    QuantConnect strives to provide a consistent environment between backtesting and live trading with as few differences as possible. In most situations, you will not notice any difference. In the following sections, we'll introduce a few features and helpers for your live trading strategies.

    To distinguish between backtesting and live, you can use the $[LiveMode,P:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.LiveMode] boolean property.
