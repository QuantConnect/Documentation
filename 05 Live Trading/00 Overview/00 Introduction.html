QuantConnect has supported live trading since 2015. We have battle-tested, colocated servers which serve thousands of live trading clients. Algorithms demand fierce stability and uptime, and now it is common for our users to achieve 6-months uptime with no interruptions. We have new, modern servers and racked them in Equinix to give the QuantConnect community the best possible stability.

    Generally speaking QuantConnect strives to provide a consistent environment between backtesting and live trading with as few differences as possible. In most situations you will not notice any difference. In the following sections we'll introduce a few features and helpers for your live trading strategies.

    To distinguish between backtesting and live you can use the $[LiveMode,P:QuantConnect.Algorithm.QCAlgorithm.LiveMode] boolean property.
