<p>Live trading servers come in sizes 512Mb, 1GB, and 2GB. These handle 99.9% of user requirements. Users often use 8-32GB of RAM in backtesting, and are concerned their live algorithms will not work. This is because in backtesting the data is being piped into your algorithm at roughly 100,000x speed. Many data objects are cached to achieve these speeds, so you use much more RAM in backtesting. </p>.
