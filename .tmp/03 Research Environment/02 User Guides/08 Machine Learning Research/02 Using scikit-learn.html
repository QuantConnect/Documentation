<p>
Scikit-learn is a framework that provides us with many ready to use algorithms for classification and regression, like support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and many more. SciKit is great to use if you want to quicky test an idea or hypothesis using a machine learning algorithm, without having to worry about building a model from the ground up.

<h4>Linear Regression Example</h4>

<p>
Regression uses past data to train a model that can predict future data. There are many different regressions with various degrees of sophistication. Linear regression is one of the simple of these models. Linear regression aims to create a linear approximation of future data. Scikit provides the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.fit">LinearRegression</a> method which creates a ready to go regression model for us to train and use.
</p>

<p>
Let's create a linear regression model trained on 30 days of historical SPY price data and use to predict the next 30 days of data. We'll need to first import our dependencies from SciKit and subscribe to SPY data.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

qb = QuantBook()
spy = qb.AddEquity("SPY") 
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Next, let's make a history call for the last 60 days of price data. We will use the first 30 days to train our model and then use the next 30 days to test our model.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># 60 days of SPY data
spy_history = qb.History(spy.Symbol, 60, Resolution.Daily)

# Drop the symbol index from multi-index dataframe
spy_history = spy_history.reset_index(level=0, drop=True)

# Get list of 60 days of open prices from dataframe
prices = list(spy_history['open'])
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The linear regression model requires two series, <i>train_X</i> and <i>train_Y</i>, to train our model with. We want to predict prices using our model so the prices will be our <i>train_Y</i>. We can use a time series starting at <i> t=0</i> as our <i>train_X</i>.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># Create time series list of training range
train_range = range(30)

# Format time series data into form compatible with LinearRegression
train_X = np.column_stack([np.ones(len(A)), A])

# First 30 days of price data used for training
train_Y = price[:30]

# Define LinearRegression model from scikit
reg = LinearRegression()

# Fit model with training data
reg.fit(train_X, train_Y)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now we can test the model's predictions on the next 30 days of data against the actual prices. First, we create a <i>test_X</i> for the entire 60 days of time, then feed the model with it and save its predictions.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># 60 day time series
test_range = range(60)

# Format time series data
test_X = np.column_stack([np.ones(len(test_range)), test_range])

# Use linear regression model to predict prices
prices_pred = reg.predict(test_X)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To visualize how well our model performs, we can plot the price data overlayed with the linear model. Let's split the price data scatter plot into two sections, blue for our training data and green for our testing data.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># The first 30 days of price data used to train model
plt.scatter(test_range[:30], prices[:30], color='blue')

# The next 30 days of price data
plt.scatter(test_range[30:60], prices[30:60], color="green")

# The linear regression model
plt.plot(test_range, prices_pred, color='red', linewidth=1)
</pre>
</div>
