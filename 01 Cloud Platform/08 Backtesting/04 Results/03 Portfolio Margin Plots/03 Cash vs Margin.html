  When you trade with a margin account, orders consume your cash before borrowing anything on margin.
  This order of precedence minimizes the interest charges on your margin loans.

  <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/terminal/processCache?request=embedded_backtest_070f21ff4785243e66df5306fb92d13d.html'>This algorithm</a> produces the following portfolio margin plot. 
  When the initial trades fill, the orders consume available cash before borrowing anything available from the margin. 
  Consuming available cash first avoids interest charges on the margin-loan, and margin calls during market downturns.
  This results in a relatively steady line hovering on 50% as there is no free cash to purchase with, but only the remaining 50% margin.

  The following portfolio margin plot shows the results.
  This version only consumes 16% of the available margin for each security, leaving a substantial amount of cash free. As the portfolio value grows, the fraction of the margin that this cash represents shrinks, showing an upward trending plot as the holdings of AAPL grow in value.
