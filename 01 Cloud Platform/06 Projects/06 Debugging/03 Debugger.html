<p>The debugger is a built-in tool to help you debug coding errors while backtesting. The debugger enables you to slow down the code execution, step through the program line-by-line, and inspect the variables to understand the internal state of the program. For more information about the backtesting debugger, see <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/backtesting/debugging'>Backtest Debugging</a>.</p>
