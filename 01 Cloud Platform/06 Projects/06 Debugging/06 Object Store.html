<p>
  The Object Store is a key-value data store for low-latency information storage and retrieval.
  During a backtest, you can build large objects you’d like to analyze and write them for later analysis. 
  This workflow can be helpful when the objects are large and plotting is impossible or when you want to perform analysis across many backtests.

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">// Save the specified key-value pair to the ObjectStore
ObjectStore.Save("key", value);</pre>
    <pre class="python"># Save the specified key-value pair to the ObjectStore
self.object_store.save("key", value)</pre>
</div>

  For a specific example of saving indicator values during a backtest into the Object Store and then plotting them in the Research Environment, see <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/object-store#12-Example-for-Plotting'>Example for Plotting</a>.
