<p>The <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/administration#05-View-the-Organization-Homepage'>organization homepage</a> displays the name of all your organization's encryption keys and provides a way to upload more. A MD5 hash of the key is recorded to know which key encoded a project.</p>

<p>The <img class='inline-icon' src='https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/encryption-missing-icon.png'> icon means the key is registered in the database but we could not locate it on your computer. This may happen when you login from a new computer. To use this key, click <span class='button-name'>Use Key</span> and upload the key with the pop-up. This process stores a copy of your key in the browser local store so you can decrypt the relevant projects in your organization.</p>
