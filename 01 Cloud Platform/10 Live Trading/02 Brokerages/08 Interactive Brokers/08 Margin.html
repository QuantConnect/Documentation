<p>We model <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages/supported-models/interactive-brokers#07-Buying-Power'>buying power</a> and <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/margin-calls'>margin calls</a> to ensure your algorithm stays within the margin requirements. If you have more than $25,000 in your brokerage account, you can use the <code>PatternDayTradingMarginModel</code> to make use of the 4x intraday leverage and 2x overnight leverage available on most brokerages from the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/buying-power#12-PDT-Rule'>PDT rule</a>.</p>
