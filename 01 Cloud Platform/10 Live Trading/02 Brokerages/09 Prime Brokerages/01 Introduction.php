<p>On the QuantConnect Local Platform, LEAN can connect to the Bloomberg™ Desktop API (DAPI) through our Terminal Link plug-in. This product is in no way affiliated with or endorsed by Bloomberg™; it is simply an add-on. Add Terminal link to your organization to access the 1,300+ prime brokerages in the Bloomberg Execution Management System network.</p>
