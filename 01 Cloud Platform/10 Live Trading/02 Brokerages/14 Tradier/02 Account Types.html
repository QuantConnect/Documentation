<p>Tradier supports cash and margin accounts. To set the account type in an algorithm, see the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages/supported-models/tradier'>Tradier brokerage model documentation</a>.</p>

<h4>Create an Account</h4>
<p>Follow the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://onboarding.tradier.com/signup">account creation wizard</a> on the Tradier website to create a Tradier account.</p>

<p>You will need your account ID and access token to deploy live algorithms. After you have an account, get your account ID and token from the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="menu-name" href="https://dash.tradier.com/settings/api">Settings &gt; API Access</a> page on the Tradier website. Your account ID is the alpha-numeric code in a drop-down field on the page.</p>

<h4>Paper Trading</h4>
<p>Tradier supports paper trading, but with the following caveats:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Account activity is unavailable since this information is populated from Tradier's clearing firm.</li>
    <li>Streaming Tradier market data is unavailable due to exchange restrictions related to delayed data.</li>
</ul>

<p>To get your paper trading account number and access token, open the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://dash.tradier.com/settings/api">API Access</a> page on the Tradier website and then scroll down to the <span class="page-section-name">Sandbox Account Access (Paper Trading)</span> section.</p>

<p>
    If you trade Equities, you can use the <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/datasets/quantconnect/us-equities">QuantConnect data provider</a> to get real-time data. 
    If you trade Options, you must use delayed data from the <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/datasets/tradier">Tradier data provider</a>. 
    If you trade Equities and Options, use both data providers. 
    However, if you trade with the demo environment, Tradier doesn't offer streaming market data due to exchange restrictions related to delayed data, so you must use our data provider.
