<p>Binance supports cash and margin accounts for spot trades, but only supports margin accounts for Futures trades. Binance US only supports cash accounts. To set the account type in an algorithm, see the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages/supported-models/binance">Binance brokerage model documentation</a>.</p>


<h4>Create an Account</h4>
<p>Follow the account creation wizard on the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://accounts.binance.com/en/register">Binance.com</a> or <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://accounts.binance.us/en/register">Binance.us</a> website to create a Binance account.</p>

<p>You will need API credentials to deploy live algorithms with your brokerage account. After you open your account, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360002502072">create API credentials</a> and store them somewhere safe. As you create credentials, make the following configurations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Select the <span class="box-name">Restrict access to trusted IPs only</span> check box and then enter our IP address, 15.235.119.112.</li>
    <li>If you are going to trade Crypto Futures, select the <span class="box-name">Enable Futures</span> check box.</li>
</ul>



<h4>Paper Trading</h4>
<p>Binance supports paper trading through the Binance Spot Test Network. You don't need a Binance account to create API credentials for the Spot Test Network.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to set up paper trading with the Binance Spot Test Network:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Log in to the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://testnet.binance.vision/">Binance Spot Test Network</a> with your GitHub credentials.</li>
    <li>In the <span class="page-section-name">API Keys</span> section, click <span class="button-name">Generate HMAC_SHA256 Key</span>.</li>
    <li>Enter a description and then click <span class="button-name">Generate</span>.</li>
    <li>Store your API key and API key secret somewhere safe.</li>
</ol>

<p>Paper trading Binance Crypto Futures or with Binance US isn't currently available.</p>

<h4>Sub-Accounts</h4>
<p>Our Binance and Binance US integrations don't support trading with sub-accounts. You must use your main account.</p>
