<p>If you need to adjust your algorithm's project files or <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/structure#06-Parameters">parameter values</a>, stop your algorithm, make your changes, and then redeploy your algorithm. You can't adjust your algorithm's code or parameter values while your algorithm executes. When you stop and redeploy a live algorithm, your project's live equity curve is retained between the deployments. To erase the equity curve history, clone the project and then redeploy the cloned version of the project.</p>
