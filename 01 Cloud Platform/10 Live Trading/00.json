Deploy your algorithms using QuantConnect because our infrastructure is battle-tested. We have successfully hosted more than 200,000 live algorithms and have had more than $15B in volume traded on our servers since 2015. The algorithms that our members create are run on co-located servers and the trading infrastructure is maintained at all times by our team of engineers. It's common for members to achieve 6-months of uptime with no interruptions.</p>",
