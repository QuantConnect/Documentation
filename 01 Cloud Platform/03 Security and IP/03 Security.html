<p>
We take a multi-level approach to security, from physical security to digital and information systems, internal processes, and testing.
</p>

<h4>Physical Security of Servers</h4>
<p>
Physical access to our servers is limited to a few dedicated team members whom QuantConnect has vetted. Only those credentialed team members can access the physical servers, and we schedule all work in advance. 
  Work on the servers is always done in pairs to prevent single rogue actors from accessing the servers. We host our servers in a world-class security facility (Equinix) with security staff 24/7.
</p>

<h4>Information and Digital Security</h4>
<p>We use all good common sense information security processes: passwordless servers, encryption in the database and backups, encrypted traffic, and network monitoring. We keep most of our servers off the internet and only available on private networks for the smallest possible surface area. We have regular network and code penetration testing. All code is containerized and isolated in services so that root network access would provide little-to-no benefit.</p>
<p>
Beyond these basics, we've built active monitoring technology that proactively detects and blocks threats. We have human detection services to reduce the chances of brute-force attacks. We have documented processes for client notifications in the event of strange network activity.
</p>

<h4>Processes</h4>
<p>Deployment environments are automated and enforce code peer-review to be deployed, reducing the chances of a rogue internal agent.</p>
<p>
We limit staff access to the physical servers, restricting core database access to only a handful of senior staff. Database credentials are carefully restricted in scope, access locations and frequently rotated.
