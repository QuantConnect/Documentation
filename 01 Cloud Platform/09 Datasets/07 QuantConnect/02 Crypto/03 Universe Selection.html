<p>The QuantConnect data provider enables you to create a dynamic universe of Crypto securities. The live data for Crypto universe selection arrives at 4 PM Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), so universe selection runs for live algorithms between 4 PM and 4:30 PM. Don't schedule anything for midnight because the universe selection data isn't ready yet.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">// Set universe to async and add a Bitfinex crypto universe with a selection filter.
UniverseSettings.Asynchronous = true;
AddUniverse(CryptoUniverse.Bitfinex(UniverseSelectionFilter));</pre>
    <pre class="python"># Set universe to async and add a Bitfinex crypto universe with a selection filter.
self.universe_settings.asynchronous = True
self.add_universe(CryptoUniverse.bitfinex(self._universe_selection_filter))</pre>
</div>
