<p>
  Each message you send and recieve through the Ask Mia panel of the IDE consumes some of your <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/support#12-Ticket-Quotas'>support seat's AI tokens</a>.
  If you exhaust your <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/support'>monthly quota</a>, you can <a href='/pricing?at=qcc&value=100'>purchase some QCC</a> to continue using Mia before your monthly allocation of AI tokens resets.
  To enable Mia to consume your QCC, open the <a href="/organization/billing">Billing</a> page, scroll down to the <span class="page-section-name">Organization Credit (QCC)</span> section, and then select the <span class="box-name">Automatically consume QCC for AI usage</span> check box.
  QCC tokens are consumed at approximately the same rate as the top model from major providers. 
  We provide this value-added wrapper on the major providers so we can offer powerful tools without violating our data licenses, enabling you to easily use the major models and still have the full benefits of QuantConnect.
