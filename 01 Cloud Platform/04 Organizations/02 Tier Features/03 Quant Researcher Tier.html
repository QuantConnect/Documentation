<p>The Quant Researcher tier is designed for self-directed investors, students, academics, and independent traders seeking to manage their personal portfolio. We recommend the Quant Researcher Pack to make the most of QuantConnect.</p>

<p>The Quant Researcher tier builds on the features included in the Free tier. Organizations on the Quant Researcher tier have access to the QuantConnect API and can use the <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/key-concepts/getting-started">CLI</a> to run Lean locally. When members in these organizations need assistance from a QuantConnect engineer, support seats are available to request <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/support">private support</a>. Members within Quant Researcher organizations that have the required permissions can adjust the resources within the organization.</p>

<p>In Quant Researcher organizations, members can use second and tick resolution data from the Datasets Market. There is no limit on the number of projects these organizations can hold. They can produce up to 100KB of logs/backtest, 3MB of logs/day. 10 million orders/backtest, and can have up to two backtesting nodes to run up to two concurrent backtests. Members in these organizations can have up to two active <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/resources#10-Coding-Session-Quotas">coding sessions</a> in the organization. After a successful backtest, members in these organizations can use <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/optimization">parameter optimization tools</a> to improve the performance of their backtest. When the members are ready to deploy strategies live, Quant Researcher organizations can subscribe to up to 2 live trading nodes to unlock <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading">live trading</a> with real or paper money. Each live algorithm in a Quant Research organization can send up to 20 Telegram, Email, or Webhook <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/notifications'>notifications</a> per hour for free. SMS notifications and additional Telegram, Email, or Webhook notifications require <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/credit'>QuantConnect Credit</a> (QCC).</p>
