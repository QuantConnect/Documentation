<p>
  If you're not going to utilize your QuantConnect subscriptions for a month or two, pause your subscriptions to avoid unnecessary charges. 
  Pausing suspends access to your account, but all your cloud configuration, project files, and set up will be kept as is. 
  When you resume your subscriptions, your account will be the same as you left it.

  <li>Click <span class='button-name'>Pause My Subscription</span>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Resume Subscriptions</h4>
<p>To resume your paused subscriptions, open the <a href='/organization/billing'>Billing</a> page and then click <span class='button-name'>Resume</span>. If you prematurely resume your subscriptions, the credit you receive is pro-rated based on the duration of the pause period.</p>
