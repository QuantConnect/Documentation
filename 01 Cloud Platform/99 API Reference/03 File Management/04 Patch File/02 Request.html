Project Id and patch content in unified diff format. The <code>/files/patch</code> API accepts requests in the following format:

<table class="table qc-table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th colspan="2"><code>PatchFileRequest</code> Model - Request to apply a patch (unified diff) to a file in a project.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td width="20%">projectId</td> <td> <code>integer<br/><i><sub>required</sub></i></code> <br/> Id of the project that contains the file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="20%">patch</td> <td> <code>string<br/><i><sub>required</sub></i></code> <br/> A patch string in **unified diff format** (as produced by `git diff`). It specifies changes to apply to one or more files in the project.

**Required format:**
- Must include `diff --git a/filename b/filename` header
- Must include `index` line (can use placeholder hashes like `1234567..abcdefg`)
- Must include `--- a/filename` and `+++ b/filename` lines
- Must include `@@` hunk headers with line numbers and context counts
- Include context lines before and after changes when possible
- Use exact line content from the file (whitespace sensitive)

**CRITICAL: The patch must match the EXACT file content including:**
- Exact whitespace (spaces vs tabs)
- Exact line endings
- Exact indentation
- All characters must match precisely

**Recommended approach:**
1. Read the current file content first
2. Use 3+ lines of context before and after the change
3. Copy exact text from the file for context lines
4. Only modify the specific line(s) that need changing

See examples for the complete structure required.
