<p>You can attach project files and backtest results to your forum comments. Sharing your project files is helpful in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Contributing to a discussion about trading strategies and implementations<br></li>
    <li>Highlighting an issue with data or Lean</li>
    <li>Requesting assistance with an algorithm or research notebook<br></li>
    <li>Sharing your interesting research and backtests with the community</li>
</ul>

<p>Sharing backtests is helpful in these situations because it enables other members to reproduce your results. However, since Lean is under constant development, old backtests that are attached to forum discussions can sometimes produce different results than they did in the past.</p>

<p>You can only attach backtests to the forum if they don't throw errors. If you want to share a backtest that throws errors, call the <code class="csharp">Quit</code><code class="python">quit</code> method method before the error occurs.</p>
