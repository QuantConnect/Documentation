    The Leaderboard lists top performing strategies ranked by performance metrics.
</p>
<p>
    We rank strategies by their returns over the last three months daily. The chart shows the equity curve of the 10 highest ranked strategies for the aforementioned period, and the table below displays the relevant metrics: the three-month return, the one-year <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/key-concepts/glossary#28-Sharpe-ratio">Sharpe ratio</a>, and the score.
</p>
<p>
    The score is the Sharpe ratio over one year with a penalty for strategies with less than one year of out-of-sample data. The penalty is proportional to the fraction of the year they have been in-of-sample. For example, a strategy that has been in-of-sample for six months will have its Sharpe ratio halved to calculate its score. A strategy submitted for over a year will have no penalty applied, and its score matches its Sharpe ratio.
