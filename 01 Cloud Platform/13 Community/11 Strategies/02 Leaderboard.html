    The Leaderboard lists top performing strategies ranked by performance metrics.
</p>
<p>
    The strategies on the Leaderboard are ranked by their out-of-sample score over the last three months. The score is the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/key-concepts/glossary#28-Sharpe-ratio">Sharpe ratio</a> over one year. Strategies with less than one year are given a penalty to their score equivalent to the fraction of the year they have been in-of-sample. For examples, a strategy that is in-of-sample for six months will have its Sharpe ratio halved to calculate its score.
