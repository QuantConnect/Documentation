<p>
    Before you investigate a trading idea, submit a proposal.
    The proposal should describe the type of strategy you want to investigate, the universe and asset classes it's applied to, the <a href='/datasets'>datasets</a> it requires, results you expect to see, and any research papers you're using as a source.
    Once you submit a proposal, we will review it and comment on your discussion thread if it’s approved or rejected.
</p>

<p>
    We only approve research that is based on some financial concept, theory, or model. 
    We reject research that is just a combination of technical indicators and overfit parameters.
    This approval process ensures you avoid spending time on research that won't end up being published.
