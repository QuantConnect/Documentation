<p>The cloud optimizer can optimize up to 2 parameters. There are several reasons for this quota. First, the optimizer only supports the <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/optimization/strategies">grid search strategy</a>, which is very inefficient. This strategy tests every permutation of parameter values, so the number of backtests that the optimization job must run explodes as you add more parameters. Second, the <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/optimization/results#05-Parameter-Charts">parameter charts</a> that display the optimization results are limited to two dimensions. Third, if you optimize with many variables, it increases the likelihood of <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/parameters#04-Overfitting">overfitting</a> to historical data.</p>

<p> We plan to upgrade the parameter charts on the optimization results page to support 3D surface charts. When we upgrade the visualization technology and add more efficient optimization strategies, we will increase the number of parameters you can optimize in the cloud. To optimize more parameters now, <a href="/docs/v2/lean-cli/optimization/deployment#02-Run-Local-Optimizations">run local optimizations with the CLI</a>.</p>
