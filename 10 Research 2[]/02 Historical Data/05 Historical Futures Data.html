<p>
QuantConnect provides trade and quote data from AlgoSeek for over 1000 Futures symbols going back as far as 2009. You can find a full list of available Futures symbols in the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/data-library/futures#Futures-Reference-Tables"> data library </a>. Futures data is available in tick, second and minute resolutions. To access data for a given Future, we need to first subscribe to its data using its ticker.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># Subcribes to data for S&P500 E-mini Futures (ES).
es = qb.AddFuture("ES")
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can also refer to Future tickers using a predefined categorized Enum. For example, The ticker for S&P 500 E-mini futures ("ES"), can be accessed with <code>Futures.Indices.SP500EMini</code>. This means we can subscribe to data for ES using <code>qb.AddFuture(Futures.Indices.SP500EMini)</code>. You can find a full list of all the tickers and their associated Enum addresses in the data library.

<h4> Setting a Filter </h4>

<p>
Futures data for a given commodity contains a chain of contracts of different expirations. We can filter the chain by expiration to narrow the data to contracts which interest us. 
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># Filter for contracts which are expiring in less than 180 days.
es.SetFilter(timedelta(0), timedelta(180))
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Making History Calls</h4>
<p>
Similar to options, future historical data can't be accessed using <code>qb.History</code>. Instead, we need to use <code> qb.GetFutureHistory</code>, which lets us access historical futures data.
</p>


<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">start_time = datetime(2019, 2, 12, 10, 30) # February 12th 2019 10:30 AM
end_time = datetime(2019, 2, 16, 16, 0) # February 16th 2019 4:00 PM

future_history = qb.GetFutureHistory(es.Symbol, start_time, end_time)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<code>qb.GetFutureHistory</code> does not return a dataframe of historical data. It instead returns a <code>FutureHistory</code> object, which lets us access the expiry and price data for the chain.
</p>

<h4>Accessing and Manipulating Data</h4>

<p>
We can access historical price data using <code>FutureHistory.GetAllData</code>
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">history = future_history.GetAllData()
</pre>
</div>
