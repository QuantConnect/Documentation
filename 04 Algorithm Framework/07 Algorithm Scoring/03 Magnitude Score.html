<p>
An insight can optionally set the expected magnitude change of the asset over the insight period. This expected return can be used in the Portfolio Construction model to improve results.
</p>
<p>The magnitude score is a measure of the magnitude accuracy of the predictions of your algorithm. If the sign of the actual and the expected magnitude change are different, you will receive a [0] score. If the magnitude change of the asset is equal or greater than the expected, your magnitude is considered correct, and you will receive a positive score of [1]. Otherwise, you will receive a score that is linearly proportional to the actual magnitude change:</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">
var actual = currentValue / startingValue - 1;
var expected = insight.Magnitude.Value;
var score = Math.Min(actual / expected, 1);
</pre>
<pre class="python">
actual = currentValue / startingValue - 1
expected = insight.Magnitude
score = min(actual / expected, 1)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The scoring system only reviews the moment of the insight completion. The sum of the insights for the backtest is averaged to give your overall magnitude score as a percentage.</p>
