<p>The Algorithm Framework is now the recommended way to design strategies in QuantConnect. Following this well-defined structure gives many advantages over conventional design:</p>
<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Pluggable Algorithm Modules</h5>
<p>By using the algorithm framework, your code will be able to instantly utilize all modules built within the framework. The modules clip together in well-defined ways, which enable them to be shared and swapped interchangeably. </p><h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Focus On Your Strengths</h5>
<p>By writing code in modules, you can focus on your strengths. If you are great at building universes, you can build universe modules. If you have risk-management experience, you could write reusable risk monitoring technology.</p><h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Reduce Development By Using Community Modules</h5>
<p>Easily share modules you've made between algorithms or pull in ones produced by the community. The strict separation of duties makes the Algorithm Framework perfect for reusing code between strategies.</p>
