    All individuals on QuantConnect own their IP on our platform. Your code is private and only accessible by people you share the project with and with support-engineers when you submit a support ticket. At no point does QuantConnect ever claim ownership of user intellectual property. The only case where algorithm code becomes public domain is when they are shared to the forum. In this case algorithms need to be made public domain to allow the sharing of the algorithm code.

    It is common when companies hire engineers to write software, they require their employees to sign an agreement which gives the company IP ownership of any code written for work. They need this because they're paying you to write software, and the company needs to sell that software to turn a profit. Similarly, the Organizations feature allows you to control who holds IP ownership over a project. Each type of organization has its own mechanisms for handling project IP ownership.

<h4>
    Individual Organizations
</h4>

<p>
    The Free Plan and the Quant Researcher subscription only allow single member organizations. This means you can't collaborate with anyone else inside the QuantConnect platform. Simply put, you own the IP for any projects you work on since you are sole collaborator.

<h4>
    Team Organization
</h4>

<p>
    For organizations which allow multiple users to collaborate on projects, the user who created the project owns it; this can be you or one of your teammates. If you add a teammate/collaborate, they can clone it, but the original project belongs to the person who first created it.

<h4>
    Trading Firm Organization
</h4>

<p>
    For Trading Firm Organizations, which are generally used by companies and funds, the firm owns all employee projects. This is made to suit firms that wish to hire consultants and need to ensure the code remains with the company when the consultant work is finished. You have to explicitly create a project in an organization for it to be created on the organization account.
