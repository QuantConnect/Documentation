You can view the nodes that are available in the resources page. Nodes are categorized by their responsibility. There are three types of nodes: Backtest nodes, Research nodes, and Live Trading nodes. Each node has its own specifications and can be given an identifying name. You can add a node by clicking Add Node in an empty node module. You will have to provide a name for your new node and also select what type of node you wish to add. You can remove a node by selecting Terminate Node. And you can also rename a node by selecting Set Name.
