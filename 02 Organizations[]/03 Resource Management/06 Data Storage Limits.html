<p>
The <a href="/docs/" class="docs-internal-link">Object Store</a> allows you to store project specific data in QuantConnect’s cache. This can be useful in saving machine learning models or other data which is expensive to compute or retrieve from external sources. Free accounts are given 500 MB in the object store which you upgrade up to 10 GB of space. You can also view how much storage space you’ve consumed so far.

<h4>Deleting Used Space</h4>
<p>
You can free used storage space by deleting the project which has stored data in the Object Store. By cloning the project before deleting it, you can maintain your code while also clearing your storage space.
