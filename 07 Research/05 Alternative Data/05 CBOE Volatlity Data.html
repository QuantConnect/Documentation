The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) provides daily exports of their most popular volatility indices. QuantConnect caches this data for easy deployment in your algorithms. You can learn more about CBOE data in the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/alternative-data/cboe"> Alternative Data </a> documentation.

<h4>Making History Calls</h4>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vix.asp">VIX</a> is a volatility index which is derived from the bid-ask spread of S&P 500 index options. It provides a measure of overall market risk and investor sentiment. The VIX's value rises when markets are unsteady and volatile, and falls when volatility recedes. 
</p>

<p>
Let's analyze how the market behaves during volatile times by comparing the VIX with SPY. We can subcribe to VIX data using <code>qb.AddData(CBOE, "VIX")</code>.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">
# We must import any custom data that we want to use
from QuantConnect.Data.Custom.CBOE import *


# Add CBOE VIX  data.
vix = self.AddData(CBOE, "VIX")

# Add SPY to see how the market is during volatile periods
spy = self.AddEquity("SPY", Resolution.Daily)
</pre>
</div>


<p>
History calls for alternative data sources are similar to history calls for price data. We can use either <code>qb.History(Type, Symbol, StartDate, EndDate)</code>, where Type is the data type, Symbol is the symbol for which to retrieve data for, or we can use <code>qb.History(Type, Symbol, Period)</code>, which returns historical data from the given past period starting from today's date.
</p>


<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># History call for 1000 days of VIX and SPY data
vix_history = qb.History(CBOE, vix.Symbol, timedelta(days=1000))
spy_history = qb.History(spy.Symbol, timedelta(days=1000), Resolution.Daily)

# drop the Symbol index from multi-index dataframe
vix_history = vix_history.reset_index(level=0, drop=True).
spy_history = spy_history.reset_index(level=0, drop=True)
</pre>
</div>

<h4> Accessing and Manipulating Data </h4>

<p>
To visualize how the spikes in the VIX correlate to in the volatility market, we can plot the daily percent change in the VIX against SPY.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># Chart formatting
plt.title('Volatility in Markets')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Returns')

# Plot the percent change in daily close values of VIX and SPY
vix_history['close'].pct_change().plot(alpha=0.5) # Increase transparency of VIX plot
spy_history['close'].pct_change().cumsum().plot()
</pre>
</div>
