There is a vast amount of alternative data available that we can use for developing signals in our Alphas. This allows us to create many unique hypotheses about the relationships between our data sources and the market, such as creating NLP models from twitter data to determine market sentiment or using Federal Reserve data to rebalance a portfolio.

QuantConnect provides a large library of alternative data sources. This includes free data sources like SEC filings, Federal Reserve data, and also paid sources like new data from Tiingo. You can find a complete list of alternative data sources in <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/data-library/alternative-data"> Alternative Data </a> documentation. Most of the alternative data sources are also available in the research environment. This allows us to directly analyze a wide variety of data.
