<p>The Federal Reserve bank of St. Louis, MO provides free macroeconomic indicators and other figures. QuantConnect hosts this Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) for use in your algorithms. This data includes various volatility measures, recession indicators, interest rates, and other factors that can be used to analyze the relationships between macroeconomic factors and the market. You can find a full list of these factors in the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/alternative-data/federal-reserve-economic-data">Alternative Data</a> documentation.

<h4>Making History Calls</h4>

<p>

Let's analyze how SPY performs when there is a recession according to the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USREC">From Period Following Peak Through The Trough</a> indicator. We can subscribe to FRED data with <code>qb.AddData(FRED, Selector)</code>, where Selector is the metric we wish to analyze.

</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">
# We must import any custom data that we want to use
from QuantConnect.Data.Custom.Fred import *



# Add SPY to see how the market reacts to the recession indicator
spy = self.AddEquity("SPY")

# Add Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) custom data
oecd = self.AddData(Fred, Fred.OECDRecessionIndicators.UnitedStatesFromPeakThroughTheTrough)

</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can then make requests for the OCED recession indicator data using <code>qb.History</code>.  History calls for alternative data sources are similar to history calls for price data. We can use either <code>qb.History(Type, Symbol, StartDate, EndDate)</code>, where Type is the data type, Symbol is the symbol for which to retrieve data for, or we can use <code>qb.History(Type, Symbol, Period)</code>, which returns historical data from the given past period starting from today's date.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># We request for 1000 days of data starting from today
spy_daily = self.History(spy.Symbol, timedelta(days=10000), Resolution.Hour)
oecd_history = self.History(Fred, oecd.Symbol, timedelta(days=10000))

# Drop the symbol index from multi-index dataframe, so that we have a time series
oecd_history = oecd_history.reset_index(level=0, drop=True)
spy_daily = spy_daily.reset_index(level=0, drop=True)
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Accessing and Manipulating Data</h4>

<p>
The OCED  <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USREC">From Period Following Peak Through The Trough</a> indicator returns a value of 0 if there is not a recession and 1 if there is a recession. In order to analyze how the indicator correlates to SPY, we can plot the daily close of SPY in red if there is a recession and in blue otherwise. We can achieve this by first plotting the overall daily close values in blue and then plotting the recessionary periods on top in red.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># Chart formatting
plt.title('OECD Recession Indicator Periods')
plt.legend(('SPY (no recession)', 'SPY (in recession)'))
plt.ylabel('price')

# Plot first so that we can put the recessionary period on top of the price graph
spy_daily['close'].plot(color='blue')
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can find the recessionary periods by looping over the time periods when there is a continous recession and adding them to a list, We cab then separate the chart into periods of indicated recession and periods of no recession.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">recessions = [] # list to hold periods of recession

# helper pointers
i = 0 
previous = 0

# Loop over values in oecd history
for period, df in oecd_history.iterrows():   
    # if there is currently a recession
    if df['value'] == 1:
        # add that date to list of recessions
        if not i == len(recessions) - 1:
            recessions.append([])
            
        recessions[i].append(period)

    # if a recessionary period has ended, increment i    
    if previous == 1.0 and df['value'] == 0.0:
        i += 1   
        
    previous = df['value']
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To plot the recessionary periods, we can loop over our list of recessions, find the start and end dates of each recession and replot the SPY daily close values in red for those periods.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">for recession in recessions:
    # Get the start and end dates of the recession period
    recession_start = recession[0]
    recession_end = recession[-1]

    # Plot the start and end of the recession in red
    spy_daily.loc[recession_start:recession_end]['close'].plot(color='red')</pre>
</div>
