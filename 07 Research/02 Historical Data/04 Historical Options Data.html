<p>,QuantConnect provides equity options data from AlgoSeek going back as far as 2010. The options data is available only in minute resolution, which means we need to consolidate the data if we wish to work with other resolutions. Options data also contains both trade data and quote data. To access options data, we need to first subscribe to an underlying and also to the option chains data for that underlying.
</p>


<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">qb = QuantBook()
spy = qb.AddEquity("SPY") # add SPY data
spy_option = qb.AddOption("SPY") # add SPY option data
</pre>
</div>

<h4>
Setting a Filter
</h4>
<p>
When we use <code>qb.AddOption("SPY")</code>, we are subscribed to the option chain data for <i>SPY</i>, which contains a large number of contracts with different rights, strikes, and expirations. We need to filter the contracts in the chain for the ones which interest us. We can do this using the <code>Option.SetFilter</code> method. There are a few different ways we can filter our options chain.
</p>

<p>
One way to refer to a strike price is to use the number of strike levels it is below or above the current market price. If <i>SPY</i> is trading at $300 and the option chain contains strikes: $285, $295, $300, $305, $310, $315, then we can refer to the $290 strike as -2 because it is 2 strikes below the current market price of <i> SPY</i>. 
</p>
<p>
We can filter the chain by the range of strike prices we are interested in. For example, we can restrict the chain to only include contracts with strike prices between -2 strikes and +5 strikes.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">spy_option.SetFilter(-2, +5)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can also filter by the range of expirations for our contracts. For example, let's restrict our chain to contracts expiring between 7 days from now and 30 days from now.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">spy_option.SetFilter(timedelta(days=7), timedelta(days=30))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can combine strike filtering and expiration filtering to narrow our chain even further. We can choose contracts which are expiring between 7 days from now and 30 days from now, whose strikes are also between -2 strikes and +5 strikes.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">spy_option.SetFilter(-2, +5, timedelta(days=7), timedelta(days=30))
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Making History Calls</h4>
<p>
Regular <code>qb.History</code> calls do not work for options. Instead, we need to use <code>qb.GetOptionHistory</code>, which allows us to request options data during a given period.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">start_time =  datetime(2017, 1, 11, 10, 10) 
end_time = datetime(2017, 1, 13, 12, 10)

# Request SPY options history between given dates
option_history = qb.GetOptionHistory(spy.Symbol, start_time, end_time)
</pre>
</div>

<p><code>qb.GetOptionHistory</code> does not return a dataframe of historical data. It instead returns an OptionHistory object, which allows us to access the strike, expiration, and price data.</p>

<p>
We can use <code>OptionHistory.GetAllData()</code> to return a dataframe containing all the price data for the options chain. This dataframe contains all the quote, trade and open interest data for each contract in our history call. It is indexed by contract expiry, strike, option right type, contract symbol, and data timestamp.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># Fetch historical price data for options chain
history = option_history.GetAllData()
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can also retrieve the set

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># Fetch strikes of all options contracts 
option_history.GetStrikes()
</pre>
</div>
