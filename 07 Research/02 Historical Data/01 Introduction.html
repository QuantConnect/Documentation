<p>
The data that is accessible in backtesting is purposefully limited, so that you are prevented from looking into the future during the backtest simulation. However, in Research you can directly access all of the available data immediately. This includes Equities, Options, Forex, and Futures data going back as far as 1998. Similar to backtesting, the data is accessed by first subscribing to a security, <code>qb.AddEquity("SPY")</code>, and then making a history call, <code>qb.History("SPY", 10, Resolution.Daily)</code>. 
</p>

<p>
The data from the history call is returned in a pandas dataframe. <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/">Pandas</a> is a python data manipulation and analysis framework. A pandas dataframe is a 2 dimensional labeled data structure, much like a spreadsheet or SQL table. A label on a row is called an Index and labels on columns are simply called columns. 
</p>

<p>
In the example below, a history request is made for all securities that been subscribed to. The resulting data frame has columns for each data type returned; these data types correspond to components of the Trade data or the Quote data available. Notice that because <i>SPY</i> and <i>BTCUSD</i> do not have Quote data, they have <i>NaN</i> values for those columns.</p>
