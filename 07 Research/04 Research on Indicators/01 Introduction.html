Indicators allow us to analyze market data in an abstract form rather than in its raw form. For example, indicators like the RSI tell us, based on price and volume data, if the market is overbought or oversold. Because indicators can extract overall market trends from price data, sometimes, we may want to look for correlations between indicators and the market, instead of between raw price data and the market. You can learn more about indicators in the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/algorithm-reference/indicators">Indicators</a> documentation.

QuantConnect provides over 100+ predefined indicators that you can use in both backtesting and in research. You can find a full list of indicators in the <a href=:"https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/algorithm-reference/indicators#Indicators-Reference-Table">Reference Table</a>. To use an indicator in QuantBook, we will need to define an instance of the indicator object. For example, to define a 10 period Bollinger Band, we will need to provide the period length, the number of standard deviations our bands extend, and the type of moving average.
