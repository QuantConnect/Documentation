Machine learning algorithms provide another way to analyze and conduct research on data. They allow us to detect patterns on large datasets and create predictive models. There are many machine learning libraries which make it easy to create, train and use various machine learning models. QuantConnect supports many of the popular frameworks like SciKit and TensorFlow. You can find a full list of the supported libraries in the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/algorithm-reference/machine-learning#Machine-Learning-Supported-Libraries">Machine Learning</a> documentation.
