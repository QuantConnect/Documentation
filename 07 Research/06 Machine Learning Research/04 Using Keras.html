Keras is a high level library for neural networks. Keras was designed to be modular fast and easy to use. It allows for easy and quick implementations of models. 
</p>

<p>
Neural networks provide a way to predict future prices based on past prices. In order to accomplish this in Keras, we will need to create a <a href="https://keras.io/guides/sequential_model/">Sequential</a> model and train it with historical data. After our model has been trained, we can test its accuracy by comparing its predictions against historical prices. First, let's import the necessary dependencies and subscribe to SPY data.
</p>


<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
from keras.optimizers import RMSprop

spy = qb.AddEquity("SPY")
</pre>
</div>

<h4> Preparing Data For Training and Testing </h4>

<p>
Let's create a model that predicts the next percent change in closing price given 5 days of OHLCV data. We can make a history call for 360 days of data that we will use to both train and test our model.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">spy_hist = qb.History(qb.Securities.Keys, 360, Resolution.Daily).loc['SPY']

# n_tsteps is the number of time steps at and before time t we want to use
# to predict the close price at time t + 1
# in this case it is 5
n_tsteps = 5

# this helps normalizes the data
df = data.pct_change()[1:]
    
features = []
labels = []

# Format data into inputs/features and outputs/labels
for i in range(len(df)-n_tsteps):
    input_data = df.iloc[i:i+n_tsteps].values
    features.append(input_data)
    label = df['close'].iloc[i+n_tsteps]
    labels.append(label)

X, y = np.array(features), np.array(labels)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now we can split our historical data into training and testing sets. We'll use the first 300 days of data to train our model and the remaining days to test our model.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">
# split data into training/testing sets
X_train = X[:300]
X_test = X[300:]
y_train = y[:300]
y_test = y[300:]</pre>
</div>

<h4> Building Models </h4>

<p>
Next, we create our neural network model. The Keras Sequential model allows us to create a neural network layer by layer. We will use a neural network with 2 hidden layers and a flatten layer, which is required because our input data is 2-dimensional; i.e. there are 5 input days, each with OHLCV data. We'll use a mean-square error loss function with an RMSprop optimizer function.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">model = Sequential([
        # 5 input variables (OHLCV) by 5 time steps
        Dense(10, input_shape=(5,5), activation='relu'),
        Dense(10, activation='relu'),

        # Flatten layer required because input shape is 2D
        Flatten(),

        # since we are performing regression, we only need 1 output node
        Dense(1)
    ])

# Set loss function and optimizer
model.compile(loss='mse',
                optimizer=RMSprop(0.001),
                metrics=['mae', 'mse'])</pre>
</div>

<h4> Training and Testing Models </h4>

<p>
Keras allows for easy training using the <code>model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs)</code> method. This method iterates through our training set once for each epoch. 
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># Train model with training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5)</pre>
</div>

<p>
Finally, let's visualize our neural networks accuracy by plotting its predictions alongside the historical prices changes. We can use <code>model.predict(x_test)</code> to retrieve our model's predictions on the test set. Then we can format our predicted prices and actual historical changes in a dataframe, and plot that dataframe.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">y_hat = model.predict(X_test)
df = pd.DataFrame({'y': y_test.flatten(), 'y_hat': y_hat.flatten()})
df.plot(title='Model Performance: predicted vs actual %change in closing price')</pre>
</div>
