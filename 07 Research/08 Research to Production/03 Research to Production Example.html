<h4>Mean Reversion</h4>

<p>
Imagine that we've developed the following hypothesis: stocks that are below 1 standard deviation of their 30 day mean are due to revert and increase in value. We've developed the following code in research to pick out such stocks from a preselected basket of stocks.
</p>


<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">import numpy as np
qb = QuantBook()

symbols = {}
assets = ["SHY", "TLT", "SHV", "TLH", "EDV", "BIL",
"SPTL", "TBT", "TMF", "TMV", "TBF", "VGSH", "VGIT",
"VGLT", "SCHO", "SCHR", "SPTS", "GOVT"]

for i in range(len(assets)):
    symbols[assets[i]] = qb.AddEquity(assets[i],Resolution.Minute).Symbol

# Fetch history on our universe
df = qb.History(qb.Securities.Keys, 30, Resolution.Daily)

# Make all of them into a single time index.
df = df.close.unstack(level=0)

# Calculate the truth value of the most recent price being less than 1 std away from the mean
classifier = df.le(df.mean().subtract(df.std())).tail(1)

# Get indexes of the True values
classifier_indexes = np.where(classifier)[1]

# Get the Symbols for the True values
classifier = classifier.transpose().iloc[classifier_indexes].index.values

# Get the std values for the True values (used for magnitude)
magnitude = df.std().transpose()[classifier_indexes].values

# Zip together to iterate over later
selected = zip(classifier, magnitude)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Once we are confident in our hypothesis, we can export this code into backtesting. We want to ultimately go long on the stocks that have been selected. One way to accomodate this model into research is to create a scheduled event which uses our model to pick stocks and goes long.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">def Initialize(self):

        #1. Required: Five years of backtest history
        self.SetStartDate(2014, 1, 1)
    
        #2. Required: Alpha Streams Models:
        self.SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.AlphaStreams)
    
        #3. Required: Significant AUM Capacity
        self.SetCash(1000000)

        #4. Required: Benchmark to SPY
        self.SetBenchmark("SPY")
        
        self.SetPortfolioConstruction(EqualWeightingPortfolioConstructionModel())
        self.SetExecution(ImmediateExecutionModel())
    
        self.assets = ["IEF", "SHY", "TLT", "IEI", "SHV", "TLH", "EDV", "BIL",
                      "SPTL", "TBT", "TMF", "TMV", "TBF", "VGSH", "VGIT",
                      "VGLT", "SCHO", "SCHR", "SPTS", "GOVT"]

        self.symbols = {}
        
        # Add Equity ------------------------------------------------ 
        for i in range(len(self.assets)):
            self.symbols[self.assets[i]] = self.AddEquity(self.assets[i],Resolution.Minute).Symbol 
        
        # Set Scheduled Event Method For Our Model
        self.Schedule.On(self.DateRules.Every(DayOfWeek.Monday), self.TimeRules.AfterMarketOpen("IEF", 1), self.EveryDayAfterMarketOpen)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now we export our model into the scheduled event method. We will switch <code>qb</code> with <code>self</code> and replace methods with their QCAlgorithm counterparts as needed. In this example, this is not an issue because all the methods we used in research also exist in QCAlgorithm.
</p>


<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"> def EveryDayAfterMarketOpen(self):
        qb = self
        # Fetch history on our universe
        df = qb.History(qb.Securities.Keys, 5, Resolution.Daily)

        # Make all of them into a single time index.
        df = df.close.unstack(level=0)

        # Calculate the truth value of the most recent price being less than 1 std away from the mean
        classifier = df.le(df.mean().subtract(df.std())).tail(1)

        # Get indexes of the True values
        classifier_indexes = np.where(classifier)[1]

        # Get the Symbols for the True values
        classifier = classifier.transpose().iloc[classifier_indexes].index.values

        # Get the std values for the True values (used for magnitude)
        magnitude = df.std().transpose()[classifier_indexes].values

        # Zip together to iterate over later
        selected = zip(classifier, magnitude)

        # ==============================
        
        insights = []

        for symbol, magnitude in selected:
            insights.append( Insight.Price(symbol, timedelta(days=5), InsightDirection.Up, magnitude) )

        self.EmitInsights(insights)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now that our model in research has been exported to backtesting, we can further analyze its performance with its backtesting metrics. And if we are still confident in our model, we can eventually live trade this strategy.
