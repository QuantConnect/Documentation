The most notable difference is that research uses QuantBook while backtesting uses QCAlgorithm. QuantBook is a wrapper on QCAlgorithm, which means QuantBook allows you to access all the methods available to QCAlgorithm; However, QuantBook contains some additional methods not found in QCAlgorithm, like <code>GetFutureHistory</code> and <code>GetOptionHistory</code>. This means that if we utilize one of these methods in research to request historical data, we will need to replace them with their QCAlgorithm counterpart <code>GetHistory</code>. <code>GetFundamental</code> in research does not have any counterpart in backtesting. Fundamental data is accessed through universe selection in backtesting.

We can, for most intents and purposes, replace <code>qb</code> with <code>self</code> when exporting code to backtesting. For example, consider the following code in the research environment.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># Initialize QuantBook
qb = QuantBook()

# Subscribe to SPY data with QuantBook
spy = qb.AddEquity("SPY")

# Make history call with QuantBook
history = qb.History(spy.Symbol, timedelta(days=10), Resolution.Daily)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can export this into backtesting by removing QuantBook and replacing <code>qb</code> with <code>self</code> by setting <code>qb = self</code>.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">def Initialize(self):

    # Set qb to instance of QCAlgorithm
    qb = self
    
    # Subscribe to SPY data with QCAlgorithm
    spy = qb.AddEquity("SPY")
    
    # Make history call with QCAlgorithm
    history = qb.History(spy.Symbol, timedelta(days=10), Resolution.Daily)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Keep in mind that in the research environment, all the data is directly available. While in backtesting, the available data is purposefully limited to the data at or before the agorithm time. This means that if we make a history request for the previous 10 days of data, in research we will receive the previous  10 days of data from today's date, while in backtesting we will receive the previous  10 days of data from the algorithm time.
