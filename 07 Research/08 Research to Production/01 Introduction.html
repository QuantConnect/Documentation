The ultimate goal of research is to produce a strategy which we can backtest and eventually live trade. Once we've developed a hypothesis that we are confident in, we can start working towards exporting our research into backtesting. We will need to translate the code in research, which relies on QuantBook into a format compatible with QCAlgorithm.
