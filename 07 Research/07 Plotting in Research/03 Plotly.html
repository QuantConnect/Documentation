<p>
Plotly is an online charting tool with a python API. It offers the ability to create rich and interactive graphs.

<h4>Example 1: Line Chart </h4>

<p>
Let's create a simple line chart of the SPY daily highs using Plotly. We'll first need to make a history call for SPY daily data.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">qb = QuantBook()
spy = qb.AddEquity("SPY")
spy_hist = qb.History(qb.Securities.Keys, 360, Resolution.Daily).reset_index(level=0)</pre>
</div>

<p>
Next, let's plot this dataframe as a line chart. We'll need to reset our indices so that we can reference our timestamps as a column. This allows us to use <code>plotly.express.line</code> to plot our dataframe.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="python"># import plotly.express
import plotly.express as px

spy_hist2 = spy_hist.reset_index()
# set the time column as our x-axis and high column as our y-axis
fig = px.line(spy_hist2, x='time', y='high') 

fig.show()
</pre>
</div>

<h4>Example 2: Candlestick Graph </h4>

<p>
Line plots limit us because they don't allow us to view all of the bar information available in our history call. We are limited to plotting only the high value of each bar. However, Plotly allows us to chart candlesticks which convey much more information about each bar, including its OHLC and whether that bar is bull or bear. Let's plot the same historical data in a candlestick chart.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">import plotly.graph_objects as go

fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Candlestick(x=spy_hist.index,
                open=spy_hist['open'],
                high=spy_hist['high'],
                low=spy_hist['low'],
                close=spy_hist['close'])],
                layout=go.Layout(
                    title=go.layout.Title(text='SPY OHLC'),
                    xaxis_title='Date',
                    yaxis_title='Price',
                    xaxis_rangeslider_visible=False
    ))

fig.show()</pre>
</div>
