<p>
QuantBook gives you access to the vast amounts of data QuantConnect hosts. Similar to backtesting, you can access that data using history calls. You can also create indicators, consolidate data, and access charting features. However, keep in mind that event-driven features available in backtesting, like universe selection and OnData events, are not available in research.

<p>
To use QuantBook, youâ€™ll need to add these references and dependencies at the start of the notebook. This is important to note for local instances of a notebook, but in the QuantConnect research environment, these references are automatically added to the notebook and hidden from sight.

<h4>QuantBook Example</h4>
<p>Using QuantBook to subscribe to SPY data and then making a history call for daily resolution SPY data.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">spy = qb.AddEquity("SPY")
history = qb.History(qb.Securities.Keys, 360, Resolution.Daily)
</pre>
<p>
Using QuantBook to create a Bollinger Band indicator for SPY, dropping the <i>standard deviation</i> column and then plotting it.
</p>
<pre class="all">bbdf = qb.Indicator(BollingerBands(30, 2), spy.Symbol, 360, Resolution.Daily)
bbdf.drop('standarddeviation', 1).plot()
</pre>
