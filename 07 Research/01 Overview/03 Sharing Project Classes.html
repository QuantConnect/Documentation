<h4>Reusing Code Between Backtesting and Research
<p>
One of the drawbacks of using the research environment you may encounter is the need to rewrite code youâ€™ve already written in a file in the backtesting environment. However, it is possible to reuse the methods written in backtesting in the research environment. You can do this by importing the classes which contain the methods you wish to use. This is a great way of reducing development time and writing more efficient code.

# reuse method from MyHelperMethods
Add(3, 4)
