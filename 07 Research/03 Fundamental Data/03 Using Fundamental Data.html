<h4>
Example 1: Finding Undervalued Stocks
</h4>

<p>
The Price-to-Earnings ratio is a measure of how expensive a company is relative to its earnings. PE ratios tend be to vary amongst industries as each industry has different operating costs and profit margins. We can find undervalued stocks by comparing its PE ratio to that of its industry. Stocks will a lower PE ratio than the industry average may be undervalued. Let's conduct an analysis on the airline industry and determine whether low PE ratio stocks outperform stocks with high PE ratios .
</p>

<p>
First let's subscribe to data for a set of airline stocks.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">qb = QuantBook()

tickers = [
    "ALK",  # Alaska Air Group, Inc.
    "AAL",  # American Airlines Group, Inc.
    "DAL",  # Delta Air Lines, Inc.
    "LUV",  # Southwest Airlines Company
    "UAL",  # United Air Lines
    "ALGT", # Allegiant Travel Company
    "SKYW"  # SkyWest, Inc.
]

symbols = [qb.AddEquity(ticker, Resolution.Daily).Symbol for ticker in tickers]</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using <code>qb.GetFundamental</code> we can retrieve the PE ratios of these stocks over 2011. Let's then plot the PE ratios over that year to visualize how they vary.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># Request PE ratio data from 2014
pe_ratios = qb.GetFundamental(symbols, 
                              "ValuationRatios.PERatio", 
                              datetime(2014, 1, 1),
                              datetime(2015, 1, 1))

# Plot PE ratios
pe_ratios.plot(figsize=(16, 8), title="PE Ratio Over Time")
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel("PE Ratio")
plt.show()</pre>

<p>
In order to see if lower PE ratio stocks do outperform higher PE ratio stocks, let's pick out the two airliners with the lowest and highest average PE Ratio over 2011.
</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># Sort stocks by their average PE ratio
sorted_by_mean_pe = pe_ratios.mean().sort_values()
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We find that ALK had the lowest average PE ratio and LUV had the highest average PE ratio over 2011.. Let's plot their returns over the following years.
</p>


<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all"># Pick out stock with highest and lowest average PE ratio
highest_avg_pe = qb.Symbol(sorted_by_mean_pe.index[-1])
lowest_avg_pe = qb.Symbol(sorted_by_mean_pe.index[0])

# History request for 2012-2015 price data for our airlines
history = qb.History([highest_avg_pe, lowest_avg_pe], 
                     datetime(2012, 1, 1), 
                     datetime(2015, 1, 1), 
                     Resolution.Daily).close.unstack(level=0)

# Calculate daily cumulative returns
returns_over_time = ((history.pct_change()[1:] + 1).cumprod() - 1)

# Plot the return
returns_over_time.plot(figsize=(16, 8), title="Returns Over Time")
plt.ylabel("Return")
plt.show()
</pre>
