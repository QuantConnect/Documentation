The foundation class for accessing QuantConnect data through Jupyter is the <code>QuantBook</code>. This is a wrapper on the QCAlgorithm class and has many of the same methods. To use this class, you need to add a few references and dependencies at the start of your notebook:

<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">from clr import AddReference
AddReference("System")
AddReference("QuantConnect.Common")
AddReference("QuantConnect.Jupyter")
AddReference("QuantConnect.Indicators")
from System import *
from QuantConnect import *
from QuantConnect.Data.Market import TradeBar, QuoteBar
from QuantConnect.Jupyter import *
from QuantConnect.Indicators import *
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Create an instance
qb = QuantBook()
</pre>
</div>
