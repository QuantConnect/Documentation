<div class="section-example-container">
	<pre class="all">from clr import AddReference
AddReference("System")
AddReference("QuantConnect.Common")
AddReference("QuantConnect.Jupyter")
AddReference("QuantConnect.Indicators")
from System import *
from QuantConnect import *
from QuantConnect.Data.Market import TradeBar, QuoteBar
from QuantConnect.Jupyter import *
from QuantConnect.Indicators import *
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Create an instance
qb = QuantBook()
</pre>
</div>
