QuantConnect provides an environment for you to perform exploratory research and brainstorm new ideas for algorithm. We simply call this the <a target="_BLANK" href="/research">research</a> environment. Here you can run Python CLI commands and explore the data directly from a <a target="_BLANK" href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a> installed in QuantConnect.
</p>
<p>
	Inside a notebook you can perform virtually any command inside a safe disposable environment. We automatically save your notebook for you. The notebooks are running a Python 3.6 shell.
</p>
<p>
	You can share a notebook by clicking the <i class="fa fa-share"></i> icon in the bottom right of the page. You can also share a notebook directly to the forums when you create a new discussion or comment.
</p>
<p>
	The foundational class for access QuantConnect data in Jupyter is the <code>QuantBook</code>. The research environment is officially in public-beta while we build out its features.
