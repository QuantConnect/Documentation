In the QuantConnect Research environment, you can import historical price data for all assets we support. This allows you to manipulate the data and perform matrix and vector operations easily. The API methods for requesting data are identical to the QuantConnect <a class="docs-internal-link" href="/docs/algorithm-reference/historical-data">History</a> methods. It requires adding the asset to the QuantBook, then submitting a history request for the prices.
